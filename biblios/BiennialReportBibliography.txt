  ABSTRACT     = {When rewriting and completion techniques are used for equational
theorem proving, the axiom set is saturated with the aim to get a
rewrite system that is terminating and confluent on ground terms.
To reduce the computational effort it should (1) be powerful for
rewriting and (2) create not too many critical pairs. These problems
become especially important if some operators are associative and
commutative (\AC). We show in this paper how these two goals can be
reached to some extent by using ground joinable equations for
simplification purposes and omitting them from the generation of new
facts.
%
For the special case of \AC-operators we present a simple redundancy
criterion which is easy to implement, efficient, and effective in
practice, leading to significant speed-ups.},

  ABSTRACT     = {We present various refutationally complete calculi for first-order clauses with 
equality that allow for arbitrary selection of negative atoms in clauses. 
Refutation completeness is established via the use of well-founded orderings on 
clauses for defining a Herbrand model for a consistent set of clauses. We also 
formulate an abstract notion of redundancy and show that the deletion of 
redundant clauses during the theorem proving process preserves refutation 
completeness. It is often possible to compute the closure of nontrivial sets of 
clauses under application of non-redundant inferences. The refutation of goals 
for such complete sets of clauses is simpler than for arbitrary sets of 
clauses, in particular one can restrict attention to proofs that have support 
from the goals without compromising refutation completeness. Additional 
syntactic properties allow to restrict the search space even further, as we 
demonstrate for so-called quasi-Horn clauses. The results in this paper contain 
as special cases or generalize many known results about Knuth-Bendix-like 
completion procedures (for equations, Horn clauses, and Horn clauses over 
built-in Booleans), completion of first-order clauses by clausal rewriting, and 
inductive theorem proving for Horn clauses.},

useful extensions of set constraints, in particular ``negative'' projections

models of each individual application are essential for performance analysis 
and troubleshooting. They are also inevitable input for network capacity 
planning and network simulation. To the best of the authors knowledge, there 
are only few publications, that describe the characterics of private enterprise 
IP networks or and virtually no papers regarding the SAP R/3 application.
This work shows an approach to analyze application specific network traffic. It 
describes, how data about network usage can be captured, filtered to a specific 
application, and how the data is prepared for the analysis. It will demonstrate 
these steps in an enterprise environment on user related traffic of a SAP R/3 
instance.},

  ABSTRACT     = {Deduction modulo consists in presenting a theory through rewrite

proof search methods based on narrowing, such as the polarized
resolution modulo. We show how to combine this method with more
traditional ordering restrictions. Interestingly, no compatibility
between the rewriting and the ordering is requested to ensure
completeness. We also show that some simplification rules, such as
strict subsumption eliminations and demodulations, preserve
completeness. For this purpose, we use a new framework based on a
proof ordering. These results show that polarized resolution modulo
can be integrated into existing provers, where these restrictions
and simplifications are present. We also discuss how this
integration can actually be done by diverting the main algorithm of
state-of-the-art provers.},

  ABSTRACT     = {In deduction modulo, a theory is not represented by a set of axioms but by a 
congruence on propositions modulo which the inference rules of standard 
deductive systems---such as for instance natural deduction---are applied. 
Therefore, the reasoning that is intrinsic of the theory does not appear in the 
length of proofs. In general, the congruence is defined through a rewrite 
system over terms and propositions. We define a rigorous framework to study 
proof lengths in deduction modulo, where the congruence must be computed in 
polynomial time. We show that even very simple rewrite systems lead to 
arbitrary proof-length speed-ups in deduction modulo, compared to using axioms. 
As higher-order logic can be encoded as a first-order theory in deduction 
modulo, we also study how to reinterpret, thanks to deduction modulo, the 
speed-ups between higher-order and first-order arithmetics that were stated by 
G\"odel. We define a first-order rewrite system with a congruence decidable in 
polynomial time such that proofs of higher-order arithmetic can be linearly 
translated into first-order arithmetic modulo that system. We also present the 
whole higher-order arithmetic as a first-order system without resorting to any 
axiom, where proofs have the same length as in the axiomatic presentation. },

validity of certain formulae (obtained using a polynomial 
reduction).
We show that the problem of checking the validity of the formulae
obtained this way is typically in NP, and identify verification
tasks which can be performed in PTIME.
These reductions can also be used for parametric systems, both
for checking safety properties given constraints on parameters,
and for deriving constraints of parameters that guarantee that
safety properties hold.},

  ABSTRACT     = {We propose an improved symbolic algorithm for the
verification of linear hybrid automata with large
discrete state spaces (where an explicit
representation of discrete states is difficult).
Here both the discrete part and the continuous
part of the hybrid state space are represented by
one symbolic representation called LinAIGs.
LinAIGs represent (possibly non-convex) polyhedra
extended by Boolean variables. Key components of
our method for state space traversal are
redundancy elimination and constraint
minimization: redundancy elimination eliminates
so-called redundant linear constraints from LinAIG
representations by a suitable exploitation of the
capabilities of SMT (Satisfiability Modulo
Theories) solvers. Constraint minimization
optimizes polyhedra by exploiting the fact that
states already reached in previous steps can be
interpreted as "don't cares" in the current step.
Experimental results (including comparisons to the
state-of-the-art model checkers PHAVer and RED)
demonstrate the advantages of our approach.},

  ABSTRACT     = {We propose algorithms significantly extending the limits for
maintaining exact representations in the verification of linear
hybrid systems with large discrete state spaces. We use
AND-Inverter Graphs (AIGs) extended with linear constraints
(LinAIGs) as symbolic representation of the hybrid state space,
and show how methods for maintaining compactness of AIGs can be
lifted to support model-checking of linear hybrid systems with
large discrete state spaces. This builds on a novel approach for
eliminating sets of redundant constraints in such rich hybrid
state representations by a suitable exploitation of the
capabilities of SMT solvers, which is of independent value beyond
the application context studied in this paper. We used a
benchmark derived from an Airbus flap control system (containing
$2^{20}$ discrete states) to demonstrate the relevance of the
approach.},

  ABSTRACT     = {We address the problem of model checking hybrid systems which
exhibit nontrivial discrete behavior and thus cannot be
treated by considering the discrete states one by one, as most
currently available verification tools do. Our procedure
relies on a deep integration of several techniques and tools.
An extension of AND-Inverter-Graphs (AIGs) with first-order
constraints serves as a compact representation format for sets
of configurations which are composed of continuous regions and
discrete states. Boolean reasoning on the AIGs is complemented
by firstorder reasoning in various forms and on various
levels. These include implication checks for simple
constraints, test vector generation for fast inequality checks
of boolean combinations of constraints, and an exact
subsumption check for representations of two
configurations.\par
These techniques are integrated within a model checker for
universal CTL. Technically, it deals with discrete-time hybrid
systems with linear differentials. The paper presents the
approach, its prototype implementation, and first experimental
data.},

  ABSTRACT     = {Reasoning can be defined as the process of applying existing
knowledge in order to produce new knowledge. In logic, there are at least two
fundamentally different sorts of reasoning: the deductive and the abductive.

Deductive reasoning (or simply deduction) is the process of deriving
consequences from what is known or assumed to be true. On the other
hand, abductive reasoning (or simply abduction) infers what needs to be assumed
to derive a given consequence. Thus, deduction
and abduction differ in the direction in which a rule has been used
for inference.

In this work, we present a calculus to generate abductive
explanations for propositional theories. The formalism is based on
propositional resolution with Set-Of-Support strategy. Furthermore,
we investigate an extension of this calculus dealing with orderings.

{\sc motel}\ serves on one hand as a knowledge base for the natural language

that this enhances the overall capabilities of the natural language processing

extensions we are working on, i.e.\ modal extension of description logics, a 
cardinality-based approach to quantitative information, reason maintenance, 
probablistic, non-monotonic, and abductive reasoning.},

  ABSTRACT     = {Saturation-based theorem provers are typically based on a calculus
consisting of inference and reduction rules that operate on sets of
clauses. While inference rules produce new clauses, reduction rules
allow the removal or simplification of redundant clauses and are an
essential ingredient for efficient implementations.
  The power of reduction rules can be further amplified by the use of
the splitting rule, which is based on explicit case analysis on variable-
disjoint components of a clause.
  In this thesis, I give a formalization of splitting and backtracking for
first-order logic using a labelling scheme that annotates clauses and
clause sets with additional information, and I present soundness and
completeness results for the corresponding calculus.
  The backtracking process as formalized here generalizes optimizations
that are currently being used, and I present the results of integrating
the improved backtracking into SPASS.},

turned into a decision procedure for interesting fragments of FOL(LA).
For example, reachability problems for timed automata can be decided
by SUP(LA) using an appropriate translation into FOL(LA). In this paper,
we extend the SUP(LA) calculus with an additional inference rule,
automatically generating inductive invariants from partial SUP(LA)
derivations. The rule enables decidability of more expressive fragments,
including reachability for timed automata with unbounded integer variables.
We have implemented the rule in the SPASS(LA) theorem prover
with promising results, showing that it can considerably speed up proof
search and enable termination of saturation for practically relevant
problems.},

  ABSTRACT     = {This paper discusses the analysis of first-order probabilistic
timed automata (FPTA) by a combination of hierarchic first-order
superposition-based theorem proving and probabilistic model checking.
We develop the overall semantics of FPTAs and prove soundness and
completeness of our method for reachability properties. Basically, we decompose
FPTAs into their time plus first-order logic aspects on the one
hand, and their probabilistic aspects on the other hand. Then we exploit
the time plus first-order behavior by hierarchic superposition over
linear arithmetic. The result of this analysis is the basis for the construction
of a reachability equivalent (to the original FPTA) probabilistic
timed automaton to which probabilistic model checking is finally applied.
The hierarchic superposition calculus required for the analysis is
sound and complete on the first-order formulas generated from FPTAs.
It even works well in practice. We illustrate the potential behind it with
a real-life DHCP protocol example, which we analyze by means of tool
chain support.},

  ABSTRACT     = {The success of superposition-based theorem proving in first-order logic relies 
in particular on the fact that the superposition calculus can be turned into a 
decision procedure for various decidable fragments of first-order logic and has 
been successfully used to identify new decidable classes. In this paper, we 
extend this story to the hierarchic combination of linear arithmetic and 
first-order superposition. We show that decidability of reachability in timed 
automata can be obtained by instantiation of an abstract termination result for 
SUP(LA), the hierarchic combination of linear arithmetic and first-order 
superposition.},

  ABSTRACT     = {In this paper an aggregation technique for generalised stochastic Petri nets 
(GSPNs) possessing synchronised parallel structures is presented. Parallel 
processes featuring synchronisation constraints commonly occur in fields such 
as product assembly and computer process communications, however their 
existence in closed networks severely complicates analysis. This paper details 
the derivation of computationally-simple closed-form expressions which permit 
the aggregation of a GSPN subnet featuring a fork-join structure. The 
aggregation expressions presented in this paper do not require the generation 
of the underlying continuous time Markov chain of the original net, and do not 
follow an iterative procedure. The resulting aggregated GSPN accurately 
approximates the stationary token distribution behaviour of the original net, 
and this is shown by the analysis of a number of example GSPNs.},

  ABSTRACT     = {Public business processes can be very complex. That makes it hard for citizens 
to understand these processes and for software companies to implement them into 
software tools. Changes of the process entail expensive effort in both teaching 
the citizens and adapting the software. For business processes several 
model-based approaches have been suggested to deal with high complexity, such 
as BPMN. However, modelling simplifies work of software developers rather than 
of citizens. We present an approach where an adequate user-interface with 
user-centric pertinent information is derived directly from the models. Our 
approach combines the advantages of having models for the software developers 
with the requirements of the users.

The modelling technique we are using is Event-driven Process Chains (EPCs). 
EPCs are widely accepted in the commercial area and are comprehensively 
investigated in the academic area as well. Due to their graphical description 
they are easy to understand. EPCs are implemented in the ARIS toolset, which 
offers the possibility to attach attributes to the elements of the EPCs. This 
paper will demonstrate how these attributes are used to derive a 
user-interface, e.g. a relevant website or document, for each state or 
transition of the EPC. The tools used extract the values of the attributes and 
incorporate them into a web-based user-interface according to the EPC of the 
modelled business process. Execution of the model then is equivalent to running 
the user-interface. A change of the process requires a change of the model 
only, which is much easier to handle than changing the implementation of the 
user-interface.},

  ABSTRACT     = {We present recent developments within the theorem prover \textsc{Waldmeister}. 
They rely on a novel organization of the underlying saturation-based proof 
procedure into a system architecture. As is known, the saturation process tends 
to quickly fill the memory available unless preventive measures are employed. 
To overcome this problem, our new ``\textsc{Waldmeister} loop'' features a 
highly compact representation of the search state, exploiting its inherent 
structure. The implementation just being available, the cost and the benefits 
of the concept now can exactly be measured. Indeed are our expectations met 
concerning the drastic cut-down of memory usage with only moderate overhead of 
time.

In addition it has turned out that the revealed structure of the search state 
paves the way to an easily implemented parallelization of the prover with 
modest communication requirements and rewarding speed-ups. In order to minimize 
communication-related latencies, we discuss some variations of the loop to 
maximally profit from multiple processors.},

to be complete provided that functions that are not in the

unsatisfiability of a goal modulo the combined theory does
not depend on the totality of the functions in the
extensions, the inconsistency will be effectively found.
Moreover, we consider a constraint superposition calculus
for the case of hierarchical theories and show that it has
a related modularity property. Finally we identify cases
where the partial models can always be made total so that
modular superposition is also complete with respect to the
standard (total function) semantics of the theories.},

%  
  Free operators occur naturally e.\,g.\ in program verification
  problems when abstracting over subroutines. If their behaviour in
  addition can be specified axiomatically, much more of the program
  semantics can be captured.
%  
  Combining the Shostak-style components for deciding the clausal
  validity problem with the ordering and saturation techniques
  developed for equational reasoning, we derive a refutationally
  complete calculus on mixed ground clauses which result for example
  from CNF transforming arbitrary universally quantified formulae.
%  
  The calculus works modulo a Shostak theory in the sense that it
  operates on canonizer normalforms. For the Shostak solvers that we
  study, coherence comes for free: no coherence pairs need to be
  considered.},

many variants of clauses which contain sums.  We describe a
refined superposition calculus for cancellative abelian monoids
which requires neither explicit inferences with the theory clauses
nor extended equations or clauses.  Strong ordering constraints
allow us to restrict to inferences that involve the maximal term
of the maximal sum in the maximal literal.  Besides, the search
space is reduced drastically by variable elimination techniques.},

  ABSTRACT     = {In the last years, the development of automated theorem
provers has been advancing in a so to speak Olympic spirit,
following the motto "faster, higher, stronger"; and the
{Waldmeister} system has been a part of that endeavour. We
will survey the concepts underlying this prover, which
implements Knuth-Bendix completion in its unfailing variant. 
The system architecture is based on a strict separation of
active and passive facts, and is realized via specifically
tailored representations for each of the central data
structures: indexing for the active facts, set-based
compression for the passive facts, successor sets for the
conjectures. In order to cope with large search spaces,
specialized redundancy criteria are employed, and the
empirically gained control knowledge is integrated to ease
the use of the system. We conclude with a discussion of
strengths and weaknesses, and a view of future prospects.},

  ABSTRACT     = {Two apparently different approaches to automating deduction are mentioned in 
the title; they are the subject of a debate on ``big engines vs.\ little 
engines of proof''. The contributions in this thesis advocate that these two 
strands of research can interplay in subtle and sometimes unexpected ways, such 
that mutual pervasion can lead to intriguing results: Firstly, superposition 
can be run on top of decision procedures. This we demonstrate for the class of 
Shostak theories, incorporating a little engine into a big one. As another 
instance of decision procedures within superposition, we show that ground 
confluent rewrite systems, which decide entailment problems in equational 
logic, can be harnessed for detecting redundancies in superposition 
derivations. Secondly, superposition can be employed as proof-theoretic means 
underneath combined decision procedures: We re-establish the correctness of the 
Nelson-Oppen procedure as an instance of the completeness of superposition. 
Thirdly, superposition can be used as a decision procedure for many interesting 
theories, turning a big engine into a little one. For the theory of bits and of 
fixed-size bitvectors, we suggest a rephrased axiomatization combined with a 
transformation of conjectures, based on which superposition decides the 
universal fragment. Furthermore, with a modification of lifting, we adapt 
superposition to the theory of bounded domains and give a decision procedure, 
which captures the Bernays-Sch\"onfinkel class as well.},

  ABSTRACT     = {  In saturation-based theorem provers, the reasoning process consists
  in constructing the closure of an axiom set under inferences. As is
  well-known, this process tends to quickly fill the memory available
  unless preventive measures are employed. For implementations based
  on the DISCOUNT loop, the passive facts are responsible for most
  of the memory consumption. We present a refinement of that loop
  allowing such a compression that the space needed for the passive
  facts is linearly bound by the number of active facts. In practice,
  this will reduce memory consumption in the WALDMEISTER system by
  more than one order of magnitude as compared to previous compression
  schemes.},

  ABSTRACT     = {Superposition is an established decision procedure for a variety of first-order 
logic theories represented by sets of clauses. A satisfiable theory, saturated 
by superposition, implicitly defines a minimal Herbrand model for the theory. 
This raises the question in how far superposition calculi can be employed for 
reasoning about such minimal models. This is indeed often possible when 
existential properties are considered. However, proving universal properties 
directly leads to a modification of the minimal model's term-generated domain, 
as new Skolem functions are introduced. For many applications, this is not 
desired because it changes  the problem.

In this thesis, I propose the first superposition calculus that can explicitly 
represent existentially quantified variables and can thus compute with respect 
to a given fixed domain. It does not eliminate existential variables by 
Skolemization, but handles them using additional constraints with which each 
clause is annotated. This calculus is sound and refutationally complete in the 
limit for a fixed domain semantics. For saturated Horn theories and classes of 
positive formulas, the calculus is even complete for proving properties of the 
minimal model itself, going beyond the scope of known superposition-based 
approaches.

The calculus is applicable to every set of clauses with equality and does not 
rely on any syntactic restrictions of the input. Extensions of the calculus 
lead to various new decision procedures for minimal model validity. A main 
feature of these decision procedures is that even the validity of queries 
containing one quantifier alternation can be decided. In particular, I prove 
that the validity of any formula with at most one quantifier alternation is 
decidable in models represented by a finite set of atoms and that the validity 
of several classes of such formulas is decidable in models represented by 
so-called disjunctions of implicit generalizations. Moreover, I show that the 
decision of minimal model validity can be reduced to the superposition-based 
decision of first-order validity for models of a class of predicative Horn 
clauses where all function symbols are at most unary.},

(2004) are investigated to automatically derive loop invariants expressing 
weakly relational numerical properties (such as $l \le x \le h$ or $l \le \pm x 
\pm y \leq h$) for imperative programs. 
Such properties have been successfully used to analyze commercial software 
consisting of hundreds of thousands of lines of code (using for example, the 
Astr\'ee tool based on abstract interpretation framework proposed by Cousot and 
his group). 
The main attraction of the proposed approach is its much lower
complexity in contrast to the abstract interpretation approach ($O(n^2)$ in 
contrast to $O(n^4)$, where $n$ is the number of variables) with the ability to 
still generate invariants of comparable strength.
This approach has been generalized to consider disjunctive invariants of the 
similar form, expressed using maximum function (such as $\max(x+a,y+b,z+c,d) 
\le \max(x+e,y+f,z+g,h)$), thus enabling automatic generation of a subclass of 
disjunctive
invariants for imperative programs as well.},

  ABSTRACT     = {Saturation-based calculi such as superposition can be successfully instantiated 
to decision procedures for many decidable fragments of first-order logic. In 
case of termination without generating an empty clause, a saturated clause set 
implicitly represents a minimal model for all clauses, based on the underlying 
term ordering of the superposition calculus. In general, it is not decidable 
whether a ground atom, a clause or even a formula holds in this minimal model 
of a satisfiable saturated clause set.

We extend our superposition calculus for fixed domains with syntactic 
disequality constraints in a non-equational setting. Based on this calculus, we 
present several new decidability results for validity in the minimal model of a 
satisfiable finitely saturated clause set that in particular extend the 
decidability results known for ARM (Atomic Representations of term Models) and 
DIG (Disjunctions of Implicit Generalizations) model representations.},

extend a disunification algorithm by Comon and Delor to ultimately periodic 
interpretations, i.e.~minimal many-sorted Herbrand models of predicative Horn 
clauses and, for some sorts, equations of the form $s^\upmb(x)\eq s^\upma(x)$. 
The extended algorithm is terminating and correct for ultimately periodic 
interpretations over a finite signature and gives rise to a decision procedure 
for the satisfiability of equational formulae in ultimately periodic 
interpretations.

As an application, I show how to apply disunification to compute the completion 
of predicates with respect to an ultimately periodic interpretation. Such 
completions are a key ingredient to several inductionless induction methods.},

  ABSTRACT     = {H-PILoT (Hierarchical Proving by Instantiation in Local Theory extensions) 
is a program for hierarchical reasoning in extensions of logical theories with 
additional functions axiomatized by a set of (universally quantified) clauses: 
deduction problems in the theory extension are reduced to deduction problems 
in the base theory. Specialized provers, as well as standard SMT solvers, are 
then used for testing the satisfiability of the formulae obtained after the 
reduction. The hierarchical reduction used in H-PILoT is always sound; it 
is complete for the class of so-called local extensions of a base theory. 

If the clauses obtained by this reduction belong to a fragment decidable in 
the base theory, H-PILoT provides a decision procedure for testing 
satisfiability of ground formulae w.r.t.\ a theory extension, and can also 
be used for model generation. This is the major advantage of  H-PILoT compared 
with other state-of-the art SMT solvers. H-PILoT can alternatively be used as 
a tool for ``steering'' the instantiation mechanism of standard SMT provers, 
in order to provide decision procedures in the case of local theory extensions.

This system description provides an overview of H-PILoT and illustrates on 
some examples the main advantage of using  H-PILoT for satisfiability 
checking in local extensions, in comparison with the performance of general 
state of the art SMT-provers.},

  ABSTRACT     = {\section*{Abstract}


Verification problems are often expressed in a language which mixes several 
theories. 
A natural question to ask is whether one can use decision procedures for 
individual theories to construct a decision procedure for the union theory. 
In the cases where this is possible one has a powerful method at hand to handle 
complex theories effectively.

The setup considered in this thesis is that of one base theory which is 
extended by one or more  theories.
The question is if and when a given ground satisfiability problem in the 
extended setting can be 
effectively reduced to an equi-satisfiable 
problem 
over the base theory. A case where this reductive approach is always possible 
is that of so-called \emph{local theory extensions.}

The theory of  local  extensions is developed and some applications concerning 
monotone functions are given.
Then the theory of local theory extensions is generalized in order to deal with 
data structures that
exhibit local behavior.
It will be shown that a suitable fragment of both the theory of arrays and the 
theory of pointers 
is local in this broader sense.
%
Finally, the case of more than one theory extension is discussed.
In particular, a \emph{modularity} result is given that under certain 
circumstances the locality of each of the extensions
lifts to locality of the entire extension.

The reductive approach outlined above has become particularly relevant
in recent years due to the rise of powerful solvers for background
theories common in verification tasks.  These so-called SMT-solvers
effectively handle theories such as real linear or integer arithmetic.
As part of this thesis, a program called \emph{\mbox{H-PILoT}} was
implemented which carries out reductive reasoning for local theory
extensions. H-PILoT found applications in mathematics, multiple-valued
logics, data-structures and reasoning in complex systems.

sets.
To generate efficient code, one wants to statically decide whether or not 
certain
memory operations access consecutive addresses.
We formalize the notion of consecutivity and algorithmically reduce the static 
decision to satisfiability problems in Presburger Arithmetic.
We introduce a preprocessing technique on these SMT problems, which makes it
feasible to apply an off-the-shelf SMT solver.
We show that a prototypical OpenCL CPU driver based on our approach generates
more efficient code than any other state-of-the-art driver.},

Nevertheless, in this paper we show that a particular combination
with superposition leads to a sound and complete calculus that
is useful in practice. We follow basically the ideas
of the SUP(LA) combination, but have to take care
of undecidability, resulting in ``unknown'' answers by
the NLA reasoning procedure. A pipeline
of NLA constraint simplification techniques related to
the SUP(NLA) framework significantly decreases the number of ``unknown'' 
answers.
The resulting approach is implemented as SUP(NLA) by a system combination
of SPASS and iSAT. Applied to various scenarios
of traffic collision avoidance protocols, we show by experiments
that SPASS(iSAT) can fully automatically proof and disproof safety
properties of such protocols using the very same formalization.},

These systems are very complex from the view of administration and
authorization. Hence they include a high potential for errors. In this
thesis I analyze the authorization concept of the SAP R/3 system as well as
different business regulations and construct a corresponding model
in first-order logic. This model can be used to check the existence
of errors automatically, i.e. a contradiction between given authorizations
and a valid business regulation. The tool I use for these checks
is the theorem prover \textsc{Spass} which has been developed at the
Max Planck Institute for Informatics. I selected the purchase process as an 
example
to explore the model construction because it is a typical constituent of the
SAP R/3 system.},

  ABSTRACT     = {We consider parametric families of semi-algebraic geometric objects, each 
implicitly defined by a first-order formula. Given an unambiguous description 
of such an object family and an intended alternative description we 
automatically construct a first-order formula which is true if and only if our 
alternative description uniquely describes geometric objects of the reference 
description. We can decide this formula by applying real quantifier 
elimination. In the positive case we furthermore derive the defining 
first-order formulas corresponding to our new description. In the negative case 
we can produce sample points establishing a counterexample for the uniqueness. 
We demonstrate our method by automatically proving uniqueness theorems for 
characterizations of several geometric primitives and simple complex objects. 
Finally, we focus on tori, characterizations of which can be applied in spline 
approximation theory with toric segments. Although we cannot yet practically 
solve the fundamental open questions in this area within reasonable time and 
space, we demonstrate that they can be formulated in our framework. In addition 
this points at an interesting and practically relevant challenge problem for 
automated deduction in geometry in general.},

namely indexing for the active facts, compression for the passive

inference steps for the proof object. In order to cope with large
search spaces, specialized redundancy criteria are employed, and the
empirically gained control knowledge is integrated to ease the use
of the system. The paper concludes with a quantitative comparison of
the {Waldmeister} versions over the years, and a view of the future
prospects.},

  ABSTRACT     = {The Lexicographic Path Order (LPO) and the Knuth-Bendix
Ordering (KBO) are two prominent term orders that are
utilised in automated theorem provers. The LPO features
some properties that allow it to be used in the context
of hierarchic signature extensions and in the presence
of term definitions, where special ordering criteria are
desired for the defined terms. The KBO, on the other
hand, can be computed more efficiently than the LPO and
it correlates better with the size of terms, but the KBO
cannot be used in the afore-mentioned situations, in
which a single term should supersede infinitely many
smaller terms of arbitrary sizes. In this diploma
thesis, we present two extensions of the KBO that
overcome these limitations. The first extension order is
suitable for hierarchic signature extensions and its
main characteristic is that it uses pairs of positive
real numbers as symbol weights, whereas the second
extension can handle the required ordering of term
definitions through the usage of ordinal numbers as
symbol weights.},

an underlying P2P network, an active area of research in distributed systems.
  Several implementations of Pastry are available and have been applied in 
practice, but no attempt has so far been made to formally describe the 
algorithm or to verify its properties. Since Pastry combines rather complex 
data structures, asynchronous communication, concurrency, resilience to 
\emph{churn} and fault tolerance, it makes an interesting target for 
verification. We have modeled Pastry's core routing algorithms in the 
specification language \texorpdfstring{\textrm{\upshape 
TLA\textsuperscript{+}}}{TLA+} and used its model checker \textsc{tlc} to 
analyze qualitative properties of Pastry such as \emph{correctness} and 
\emph{consistency}.},

By an exhaustive experiment of all first-order TPTP problems,
it shows that our clause normal form transformation yields fewer clauses and 
fewer literals
than the methods known and used so far.
This often allows for exponentially shorter proofs and,
in some cases, it makes it even possible for a theorem prover to find a proof

unable to do so with more standard clause normal form transformations.},

this occurs systematically are the relational translation from modal

  ABSTRACT     = {Interpolation is an important component of recent methods for
program verification. It provides a natural and effective means 
for computing separation between the sets of `good' and `bad' 
states. The existing algorithms for interpolant generation are
proof-based: They require explicit construction of proofs, 
from which interpolants can be computed.  
Construction of such proofs is a difficult task. 
We propose an algorithm for the generation of interpolants 
for the combined theory of linear arithmetic and uninterpreted
function symbols that does not require a priori constructed 
proofs to derive interpolants. It uses a reduction of
the problem to constraint solving in linear arithmetic, 
which allows application of existing highly optimized Linear 
Programming solvers in black-box fashion. 
We provide experimental evidence of the practical 
applicability of our algorithm.},

  ABSTRACT     = {Many problems in mathematics and computer science 
(e.g. in verification, or when reasoning in and about 
distributed databases) can be reduced to proving the
satisfiability of conjunctions of (ground) literals modulo 
a background theory. This theory can, for instance, be the
extension of a base theory with additional functions or a
combination of theories.
It is therefore very important to find efficient methods for 
checking the unsatisfiability of ground formulae in such 
complex theories. However, it is often equally important 
to find local causes for inconsistency. Such information is
usually provided by interpolants. 
 
In this paper we study interpolation in local extensions of a 
base theory ${\cal T}_0$. In such extensions efficient 
hierarchical reasoning -- in which a prover for the base theory
is used as a black box -- is possible. 
We identify situations in which it is possible to obtain 
interpolants in a hierarchical manner, by using a prover 
and a procedure for generating interpolants in ${\cal T}_0$ 
as `black-boxes' in order to generate interpolants in the 
extension.

We provide several examples of such theories, and discuss 
their applications in verification or knowledge representation.},

functions over theories of data types which satisfy

focus on emphasizing possibilities of hierarchical and

We start by considering theories of absolutely free data 
structures, and continue by studying extensions of such 
theories with selectors, with functions which attach scalar 
data to the data structures and with additional functions 
defined using a certain type of recursion axioms (possibly 
having values in a different -- e.g.\ numeric -- domain).
We show that in these cases locality results can be established. 
This allows us to reduce the task of reasoning about the class 
of recursive functions we consider to reasoning in the 
underlying theory of absolutely free data structures 
(resp. in a combination of the theory of absolutely free data 
structures with the theory attached with the domains of the
additional functions). We then show that similar results can be 
obtained if we relax some assumptions about the absolute 
freeness of the underlying theory of data types. We investigate 
the applications of these ideas in verification and cryptography.},

  ABSTRACT     = {We study possibilities of reasoning about extensions of base 
theories with functions which satisfy certain recursion and 
homomorphism properties. Our focus is on emphasizing 
possibilities of hierarchical and modular reasoning in such 
extensions and combinations thereof.

\begin{itemize}
\item[(1)] We show that the theory of absolutely free 
constructors is local, and locality is preserved also in the 
presence of selectors. These results are consistent with 
existing decision procedures for this theory (e.g. by Oppen).

\item[(2)] We show that, under certain assumptions, extensions 
of the theory of absolutely free constructors with functions 
satisfying a certain type of recursion axioms satisfy locality 
properties, and show that for functions with values in an 
ordered domain we can combine recursive definitions with 
boundedness axioms without sacrificing locality. We also address 
the problem of only considering models whose data part is
the {em initial} term algebra of such theories.

\item[(3)] We analyze conditions which ensure that similar 
results can be obtained if we relax some assumptions about the 
absolute freeness of the underlying theory of data types, and 
illustrate the ideas on an example from cryptography.
\end{itemize}

The locality results we establish allow us to reduce the task of 
reasoning about the class of recursive functions we consider to 
reasoning in the underlying theory of data structures (possibly 
combined with the theories associated with the co-domains of 
the recursive functions).

As a by-product, the methods we use provide a possibility of 
presenting in a different light (and in a different form) 
locality phenomena studied in cryp-to-gra-phy; we believe that
they will allow to better separate rewriting from proving, and 
thus to give simpler proofs. },

non-classical logics into first order logic and resolution

We present several classes of  non-classical logics, many of
which are of great practical relevance in knowledge

  ABSTRACT     = {Many problems in computer science can be reduced to proving the satisfiability 
of conjunctions of literals w.r.t. a background theory. This theory can be a 
concrete theory (e.g. the theory of real or rational numbers), the extension of 
a theory with additional functions (free, monotone, or recursively defined) or 
a combination of theories. It is therefore very important to have efficient 
procedures for checking the satisfiability of conjunctions of ground literals 
in such theories.

We here give an overview of results on hierarchical and modular reasoning in 
complex theories. We show that for a special type of extensions of a base 
theory, which we call local, hierarchic reasoning is possible (i.e. proof tasks 
in the extension can be hierarchically reduced to proof tasks w.r.t. the base 
theory). Many theories important for computer science or mathematics fall into 
this class (typical examples are theories of data structures, theories of free 
or monotone functions, but also functions occurring in mathematical analysis).

In fact, it is often necessary to consider complex extensions, in which various 
types of functions or data structures need to be taken into account at the same 
time. We show how such local theory extensions can be identified and under 
which conditions locality is preserved when combining theories, and we 
investigate possibilities of efficient modular reasoning in such theory 
combinations.
We present several examples of application domains where such theories occur in 
a natural way. We show, in particular, that various phenomena analyzed in the 
verification literature can be explained in a unified way using the notion of 
locality.},

-------------------

Abstract: 

The applications of algebra and logic in computer science are
particularly abundant nowadays; in fact logic is often called
"the calculus of computer science".  On the other hand, the
development of computer science has a strong impact on the
research in algebra and logic, and in particular on the research
in computational mathematics and automated theorem proving.

\smallskip
In this talk I will present two, strongly interrelated, directions
of my recent research, which reflect some of the links between
algebra, logic and computer science emphasized above:

\begin{itemize}
\item Decompositions of algebraic structures in terms of simpler
   structures, and applications to automated theorem proving.

\item A study of interaction in complex systems, and applications
   to modular checking of certain properties of systems obtained
   by composing simpler systems.
\end{itemize}


Antrittsvorlesung
-----------------

Abstract:

One of the most important problems in computer science is to 
identify decidable and tractable fragments of (first- or 
higher-order) logic, and to develop efficient deductive 
calculi for these fragments.
However, in most real-life applications it is necessary to 
consider combinations of theories which are, usually, 
extensions of a shared base theory. 
Two important questions arise in this context:

\begin{itemize}
\item Assume that we have a complete prover for a logical theory.
    Can one use this prover as a ``black-box'' to prove theorems
    in an extension of the theory?

\item Assume that we have complete provers for two theories.
    Can we obtain a complete prover for their combination,
    by using the provers of the components as ``black-boxes''?
\end{itemize}

In this talk we present several situations in which hierarchical 
and modular reasoning is possible, and point out similarities 
and differences between various approaches to modular theorem
proving in combinations of logical theories.},

of distributive lattices with many sorted bridging operators. 
Our interest in such algebras 
is motivated by the fact that, in description logics, 
numerical features are often expressed by using maps that 
associate numerical values to sets (more generally, 
to lattice elements).
We first establish a link between satisfiability 
of universal sentences 
with respect to algebraic models and satisfiability with respect to 
certain classes of relational structures. 
We use these results for giving a method for 
translation to clause form of universal sentences, 
and provide some decidability results based on the use of 
resolution or hyperresolution.   
Links between hyperresolution and tableau methods are also 
discussed, and a tableau procedure for checking satisfiability 
of formulae of type $t_1 \leq t_2$ is obtained by using a 
hyperresolution calculus.},

  ABSTRACT     = {One of the most important objectives of the research in mathematics and 
computer science is to obtain means of reasoning in and about complex systems. 
These can be, for instance complex mathematical theories; programs, or 
generally reactive or hybrid systems; distributed databases; or complex systems 
in general (e.g. multi-agent systems or reactive or hybrid systems with 
embedded software, whose behavior is controlled by databases, reasoning about 
knowledge and belief, planning mechanisms, or programs). Proving that such 
systems have certain properties (e.g. that they are safe, that they behave 
correctly, or that the information they use does not contain inconsistencies) 
is extremely important: In safety-critical systems (such as cars, trains, 
planes, or power-plants) even small mistakes can provoke disasters. Since the 
amount of data which has to be handled in verification tasks is usually huge, 
computer support is indispensable. The dream of the scientists is to provide 
such correctness proofs automatically. This goal cannot be reached in its full 
generality: As shown by undecidability results going back to the work of G{\"o}del, 
Church and Turing, it is impossible to write a program for checking arbitrary 
properties of general systems. However, for concrete application domains, 
automatic procedures exist. It is therefore very important to identify 
situations in which automated verification of complex systems is possible. For 
this, it is essential to identify theories which are decidable, preferably with 
low complexity, and - since concrete problems often are quite heterogeneous in 
nature - to obtain methods for efficiently combining decision procedures.

The goal of the tutorial is to give a comprehensive, in-depth perspective of 
recent advances in the field of reasoning in complex logical theories, and to 
present applications of these results in various areas ranging from formal 
verification to reasoning about knowledge. The tutorial introduces the general 
principles underlying reasoning in complex theories from a unifying 
perspective, gives a survey of recent achievements in the field, and 
illustrates the problems and their solutions using a selection of examples from 
mathematics, verification, and knowledge representation.},

  ABSTRACT     = {We give a method for deciding unifiability in the variety 
of bounded distributive lattices. 
For this, we reduce the problem of deciding whether a 
unification problem ${\cal S}$ has a solution to the 
problem of checking the satisfiability of a set 
$\Phi_{\cal S}$ of ground clauses. 
This is achieved by using a structure-preserving 
translation to clause form.   
The satisfiability check can then be performed 
either by a resolution-based theorem prover or 
by a SAT checker.  We apply the method to 
unification with free constants and to unification 
with linear constant restrictions, and show that, 
in fact, it yields a decision procedure for the positive 
theory of the variety of bounded distributive lattices.
We also consider the problem of unification over 
(i.e.\ in an algebraic extension of) the free lattice. 
Complexity issues are also addressed.},

  ABSTRACT     = {In this paper we present a method for automated theorem proving in 
finitely-valued logics whose algebra of truth values is a distributive lattice 
with operators. The method uses the Priestley dual of the algebra of truth 
values instead of the algebra itself (this dual 
is used as a finite set of possible worlds). 
We first present a procedure that constructs, for every formula $\phi$ in the 
language of such a logic, a set $\Phi$ of clauses  such that $\phi$ is a 
theorem if and only if $\Phi$ is unsatisfiable. Compared to related approaches, 
the method presented here leads in many cases to a reduction of the number of 
clauses that are generated, especially when the set of truth values is not 
linearly ordered.
We then discuss several possibilities for checking the unsatisfiability of 
$\Phi$, among which a version of signed hyperresolution, and give several 
examples. },

  ABSTRACT     = {In this paper we give a method for automated theorem proving in the universal 
theory of certain varieties of distributive lattices with well-behaved 
operators. For this purpose, we use extensions of Priestley's representation 
theorem for distributive lattices. We first establish a link between 
satisfiability of universal sentences with respect to varieties of distributive 
lattices with operators and satisfiability with respect to certain classes of 
relational structures. We then use these results for giving a method for 
translation to clause form of universal sentences in such varieties, and obtain 
decidability and complexity results for the universal theory of some such 
varieties. The advantage is that we avoid the explicit use of the full 
algebraic structure of such lattices, instead using sets endowed with a 
reflexive and transitive relation and with additional functions and relations. 
We  first studied this type of relationships in the context of finitely-valued 
logics and then extended the ideas to more 

general non-classical logics. This  paper shows that the idea is much more 
general. In particular, the method presented here subsumes both existing 
methods for translating modal logics to classical logic and methods for 
automated theorem proving in finitely-valued logics based on distributive 
lattices with operators. },

  ABSTRACT     = {Many problems in mathematics and computer science can be
reduced to proving the satisfiability of conjunctions of 
literals in a background theory which is often the extension 
of a base theory with additional functions or a combination 
of theories.
It is therefore important to have efficient procedures for 
checking satisfiability of conjunctions of ground literals 
in extensions and combinations of theories.
For a special type of theory extensions, namely {\em local 
extensions},  hierarchic reasoning, in which a theorem prover 
for the base theory can be used as a ``black box'',  
is possible. Many theories used in computer science or 
mathematics are local extensions of a base theory.
However, often it is necessary to consider complex extensions 
of a theory, with various types of functions.

In this paper we identify situations in which
a combination of local extensions of a base theory 
is guaranteed to be again a local extension of the base theory.
We thus obtain criteria both for recognizing wider classes of 
local theory extensions, and for modular reasoning in 
combinations of theories over non-disjoint signatures.},

  ABSTRACT     = {The main goal of this paper is to give a better understanding of 
existing many-valued resolution procedures, and thus help to improve 
the efficiency of automated theorem proving in finitely-valued logics. 
First, we briefly present a method for translation to clause form 
in finitely-valued logics based on distributive lattices with operators, 
which uses the Priestley dual of the algebra of truth values.
We show that the unsatisfiability of the set of signed clauses thus 
obtained can be checked by a version of signed negative hyperresolution. 
This extends the results established by H\"ahnle in the case of regular logics,
where the set of truth values is linearly ordered. As in the case of regular 
hyperresolution, also our version of signed hyperresolution is surprisingly 
similar to the classical version. In the second part of the paper we explain 
why regular logics and the logics we consider are so well-behaved.
We show that in both cases the translation to clause form  is actually a
translation to classical logic, and that soundness and completeness of various
refinements of the (signed) resolution procedure follow as a consequence of 
results from first-order logic. Decidability and complexity results for signed
clauses follow as well, by using results from first-order logic. This explains
and extends earlier results on theorem proving in finitely-valued logics.},

  ABSTRACT     = {The main goal of this paper is to present a method for translation to clause 
form in finitely-valued logics having as algebras of truth values distributive 
lattices with certain types of operators. The method uses the Priestley dual of 
the algebra of truth values. We illustrate these general ideas by several 
examples, and show that the general complexity can be further improved by using 
the structure of particular algebras of truth values. We then show that these 
ideas are actually much more general: we further develop one of our previous 
ideas where we showed that Priestley duality is useful in better understanding 
the link between algebraic and Kripke-style models for certain non-classical 
logics, and give several examples.},

Through a series of case studies, we show how first-order formulas over the 
reals arise when formally analyzing models of complex control systems. Existing 
off-the-shelf quantifier elimination procedures are not successful in 
eliminating quantifiers from many of our benchmarks. We therefore automatically 
combine three established software components: virtual subtitution based 
quantifier elimination in Reduce/Redlog, cylindrical algebraic decomposition 
implemented in Qepcad, and the simplifier Slfq implemented on top of Qepcad. We 
use this combination to successfully analyze various models of systems 
including adaptive cruise control in automobiles, adaptive flight control 
system, and the classical inverted pendulum problem studied in control theory.},

  ABSTRACT     = {This paper introduces a new decision procedure for PLTL based on labelled 
superposition.
Its main idea is to treat temporal formulas as infinite sets of purely 
propositional clauses over an extended signature. These infinite sets are then 
represented by finite sets of labelled propositional clauses. The new 
representation enables the  replacement of the complex temporal resolution 
rule, suggested by existing resolution calculi for PLTL, by a fine grained 
repetition check of finitely saturated labelled clause sets followed by a 
simple inference. The completeness argument is based on the standard model 
building idea from superposition. It inherently justifies ordering 
restrictions, redundancy elimination and effective partial model building. The 
latter can be directly used to effectively generate counterexamples of 
non-valid PLTL conjectures out of saturated labelled clause sets in a 
straightforward way.},

Bernays-Sch¨onfinkel Horn class with equality. A new
variant of the superposition calculus is sound, complete
and terminating for this class. Together with extended term
indexing data structures the new calculus is implemented in
Spass-YAGO. YAGO can be finitely saturated by Spass-YAGO in
about 1 hour.We have found 49 inconsistencies in the original
generated ontology which we have fixed. Spass-YAGO can then
prove non-trivial conjectures with respect to the resulting
saturated and consistent clause set of about 1.4 GB in less

  ABSTRACT     = {We give a method for extending efficient SMT solvers to handle quantifiers, 
using Superposition inference rules. In our method, the input formula is 
converted into CNF as in traditional first order logic theorem provers. The 
ground clauses are given to the SMT solver, which runs a DPLL method to build 
partial models. The partial model is passed to a Congruence Closure procedure, 
as is normally done in SMT. Congruence Closure calculates all reduced 
(dis)equations in the partial model and passes them to a Superposition 
procedure, along with a justification. The Superposition procedure then 
performs an inference rule, which we call Justified Superposition, between the 
(dis)equations and the nonground clauses, plus usual Superposition rules with 
the nonground clauses. Any resulting ground clauses are provided to the DPLL 
engine. We prove the completeness of this method, using a nontrivial 
modification of Bachmair and Ganzinger’s model generation technique. We believe 
this combination uses the best of both worlds, an SMT process to handle ground 
clauses efficiently, and a Superposition procedure which uses orderings to 
handle the nonground clauses.},

  prime interest for building efficient systems, but their effective
  use is often limited by poor interface capabilities, when such
  procedures only provide a simple ``sat/unsat'' answer.  In this
  paper, we develop a framework to design cooperation schemas between
  such procedures while maintaining modularity of their
  interfaces.  First, we use the framework to specify and prove the
  correctness of classic combination schemas by Nelson-Oppen and
  Shostak.  Second, we introduce the concept of deduction complete
  satisfiability procedures, we show how to build them for large
  classes of theories, then we provide a schema to modularly
  combine them.  Third, we consider the problem of modularly
  constructing explanations for combinations by re-using available
  proof-producing procedures for the component theories.},

leading to a significant reduction of the number of variable
overlaps. In particular, we demonstrate that in divisible
torsion-free abelian groups, variable overlaps, AC-unification
and AC-orderings can be avoided completely.},

letters of the Latin alphabet (or other alphabets of comparable
size), which combines in a uniform way short key sequences for
frequently used characters with an easily memorizable scheme to
enter rarely used characters. Compared with traditional modifier
techniques, SITMO requires less additional keys and allows
to access more characters, while for most European languages,
the average number of keystrokes per derived letter is similar
(that is, close to 2).},

  ABSTRACT     = {Order-sorted specifications (i.e., many-sorted specifications with subsort 
relations) have been proved to be a useful tool for the description of 
partially defined functions and error handling in abstract data types. \par 
Several definitions for order-sorted algebras have been proposed. In some 
papers an operator symbol, which may be multiply declared, is interpreted by a 
family of functions (``overloaded'' algebras), in other papers it is always 
interpreted by a single function (``non-overloaded'' algebras). On the one 
hand, we try to demonstrate the differences between these two approaches with 
respect to equality, rewriting, and completion; on the other hand, we prove 
that in fact both theories can be studied parallelly, provided that certain 
notions are suitably defined. \par The overloaded approach differs from the 
many-sorted and the non-overloaded case, in that the overloaded term algebra is 
not necessarily initial. We give a decidable sufficient criterion for the 
initiality of the term algebra, which is less restrictive than GJM-regularity 
as proposed by Goguen, Jouannaud, and Meseguer. \par Sort decreasingness is an 
important property of rewrite system, since it ensures that confluence and 
Church-Rosser property are equivalent, that the overloaded and non-overloaded 
rewrite relations agree, and that variable overlaps do not yield critical 
pairs. We prove that it is decidable whether or not a rewrite rule is sort 
decreasing, even if the signature is not regular. \par Finally we demonstrate 
that every overloaded completion procedure may also be used in the 
non-overloaded world, but not conversely, and that specifications exist that 
can only be completed using the non-overloaded semantics.},

  ABSTRACT     = {We present a sound and complete calculus for an expressive sorted first-order logic. Sorts are extended to the semantic and pragmatic use of unary predicates. A sort may denote an empty set and the sort structure can be created by making use of the full first-order language. Technically spoken, we allow sort declarations to be used in the same way than ordinary atoms. Therefore we can compile every first-order logic formula into our logic.\\ The extended expressivity implies an extended sorted inference machine. We present a new unification algorithm and show that the declarations the unification algorithm is built on have to be changed dynamically during the deduction process. Deductions in the resulting resolution calculus are very efficient compared to deductions in the unsorted resolution calculus. The approach is a conservative extension of the known sorted approaches, as it simplifies to the known sorted calculi if we apply the calculus to the much more restricted input formulas of these calculi.},

  ABSTRACT     = {In this paper I extend the standard first-order resolution method with special reasoning mechanisms for sorts. Sorts are one place predicates. Literals built from one place predicates are called sort literals. Negative sort literals can be compiled into restrictions of the relevant variables to sorts or can be deleted if they fulfill special conditions. Positive sort literals define the sort structure for sorted unification. Sorted unification exploits the sort restrictions of variables. As the occurrence of sort literals is not restricted, it might be necessary to add additional literals to resolvents and factors and to dynamically change the set of positive sort literals used by sorted unification during the deduction process. The calculus I propose thus extends the standard resolution method by sorted unification, residue literals and a dynamic processing of the sort information. I show that this calculus generalizes and improves existing approaches to sorted reasoning. Finally I give some applications to automated theorem proving and abduction.},

Semantically, the domain of a variable is restricted to the intersection of the denotations of the attached predicates. Syntactically, the sort information is exploited by modified $\gamma$ and $\delta$ rules. The standard unification algorithm of free variable tableau is replaced by a sorted unification algorithm. The resulting calculi, tableau with sorts and free variable tableau with sorts are proved sound, complete and more suitable for mechanization than their counterparts without sorts.},

  ABSTRACT     = {
First-order theorem proving with equality is undecidable, in general. 
However, it
is semi-decidable in the sense that it is refutationally complete. The 
basis for a
(semi)-decision procedure for first-order clauses with equality is a 
calculus composed
of inference and reduction rules. The inference rules of the calculus 
generate
new clauses whereas the reduction rules delete clauses or transform them 
into simpler
ones. If, in particular, strong reduction rules are available, 
decidability of
certain subclasses of first-order logic can be shown. Hence, 
sophisticated reductions
are essential for progress in automated theorem proving. In this thesis we
consider the superposition calculus and in particular the sophisticated 
reduction
rule Contextual Rewriting. However, it is in general undecidable whether 
contextual
rewriting can be applied. Therefore, to make the rule applicable in 
practice,
it has to be further refined. In this work we develop an instance of 
contextual
rewriting which effectively performs contextual rewriting and we 
implement this
in the theorem prover Spass.},

  ABSTRACT     = {First-order logic combined with arithmetic background theories is a
powerful tool for representing and managing huge amounts of
declarative information. Special fragments of it were successfully
applied to manifold problems from different areas of computer
science. From an automated reasoning perspective, however, this
expressiveness makes it particular challenging to develop theorem
provers that can deal with general classes of those languages:
General purpose theorem provers on the one hand cannot cope
efficiently with arithmetic and specialized decision procedures on
the other hand are notoriously bad at dealing with quantifiers, if
they are even supported at all.

The SPASS+T system, which was developed by Prevosto and Waldmann,
aims to attack this problem by combining the superposition-based
theorem prover SPASS with decision procedures for linear arithmetic
and free function symbols; furthermore, the set of standard
first-order inference and reduction rules is complemented by
specialized rules for arithmetic.

In this work we present various extensions to their initial
implementation. The main task of the thesis was to stretch the
capabilities of the system by integrating the SPASS splitting rule,
which had to be switched off so far. Splitting is highly efficient
for SPASS and has also advantages in a combination like SPASS+T. In
order to add support for splitting in SPASS+T we first revised the
previous system architecture and developed an advanced coupling
between SPASS and the SMT procedure and achieved a tighter
integration of the latter in form of a new inference rule.
Furthermore, for splitting a careful analysis of the different
prover configurations was necessary. Besides splitting, the new
coupling also allows to use the SPASS proof documentation mode
regarding subproofs that were contributed by the SMT procedure. The
documented proofs can be automatically certified. To this end we
extended the existing SPASS proof validator in such a way that it
also employs an external SMT procedure and now can verify, besides
ordinary first-order proof steps, arithmetic inferences as well. In
order to improve the built-in arithmetic simplification rules of
SPASS+T and let them also work with bignums and rational numbers, we
integrated the GNU multiple precision library. Finally, we added a
new reduction rule that deals with clauses which impose lower or
upper bounds on a variable.

We will describe all these extensions in detail, discuss their
impact on the system architecture, and demonstrate the capabilities
of the system by applying it to some examples.},
