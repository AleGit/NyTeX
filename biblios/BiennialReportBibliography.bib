	Abstract = {When rewriting and completion techniques are used for equational
theorem proving, the axiom set is saturated with the aim to get a
rewrite system that is terminating and confluent on ground terms.
To reduce the computational effort it should (1) be powerful for
rewriting and (2) create not too many critical pairs. These problems
become especially important if some operators are associative and
commutative (\AC). We show in this paper how these two goals can be
reached to some extent by using ground joinable equations for
simplification purposes and omitting them from the generation of new
facts.
%
For the special case of \AC-operators we present a simple redundancy
criterion which is easy to implement, efficient, and effective in
practice, leading to significant speed-ups.},

	Abstract = {We present various refutationally complete calculi for first-order clauses with 
equality that allow for arbitrary selection of negative atoms in clauses. 
Refutation completeness is established via the use of well-founded orderings on 
clauses for defining a Herbrand model for a consistent set of clauses. We also 
formulate an abstract notion of redundancy and show that the deletion of 
redundant clauses during the theorem proving process preserves refutation 
completeness. It is often possible to compute the closure of nontrivial sets of 
clauses under application of non-redundant inferences. The refutation of goals 
for such complete sets of clauses is simpler than for arbitrary sets of 
clauses, in particular one can restrict attention to proofs that have support 
from the goals without compromising refutation completeness. Additional 
syntactic properties allow to restrict the search space even further, as we 
demonstrate for so-called quasi-Horn clauses. The results in this paper contain 
as special cases or generalize many known results about Knuth-Bendix-like 
completion procedures (for equations, Horn clauses, and Horn clauses over 
built-in Booleans), completion of first-order clauses by clausal rewriting, and 
inductive theorem proving for Horn clauses.},

This work shows an approach to analyze application specific network traffic. It 
describes, how data about network usage can be captured, filtered to a specific

these steps in an enterprise environment on user related traffic of a SAP R/3

	Abstract = {Deduction modulo consists in presenting a theory through rewrite
rules to support automatic and interactive proof search. It induces
proof search methods based on narrowing, such as the polarized
resolution modulo. We show how to combine this method with more
traditional ordering restrictions. Interestingly, no compatibility
between the rewriting and the ordering is requested to ensure
completeness. We also show that some simplification rules, such as
strict subsumption eliminations and demodulations, preserve
completeness. For this purpose, we use a new framework based on a
proof ordering. These results show that polarized resolution modulo
can be integrated into existing provers, where these restrictions
and simplifications are present. We also discuss how this
integration can actually be done by diverting the main algorithm of
state-of-the-art provers.},

@article{Burel2010a,
	Abstract = {In deduction modulo, a theory is not represented by a set of axioms but by a 
congruence on propositions modulo which the inference rules of standard 
deductive systems---such as for instance natural deduction---are applied. 
Therefore, the reasoning that is intrinsic of the theory does not appear in the 
length of proofs. In general, the congruence is defined through a rewrite 
system over terms and propositions. We define a rigorous framework to study 
proof lengths in deduction modulo, where the congruence must be computed in 
polynomial time. We show that even very simple rewrite systems lead to 
arbitrary proof-length speed-ups in deduction modulo, compared to using axioms. 
As higher-order logic can be encoded as a first-order theory in deduction 
modulo, we also study how to reinterpret, thanks to deduction modulo, the 
speed-ups between higher-order and first-order arithmetics that were stated by 
G\"odel. We define a first-order rewrite system with a congruence decidable in 
polynomial time such that proofs of higher-order arithmetic can be linearly 
translated into first-order arithmetic modulo that system. We also present the 
whole higher-order arithmetic as a first-order system without resorting to any 
axiom, where proofs have the same length as in the axiomatic presentation. },

	Abstract = {We address the problem of model checking hybrid systems which
exhibit nontrivial discrete behavior and thus cannot be
treated by considering the discrete states one by one, as most
currently available verification tools do. Our procedure
relies on a deep integration of several techniques and tools.
An extension of AND-Inverter-Graphs (AIGs) with first-order
constraints serves as a compact representation format for sets
of configurations which are composed of continuous regions and
discrete states. Boolean reasoning on the AIGs is complemented
by firstorder reasoning in various forms and on various
levels. These include implication checks for simple
constraints, test vector generation for fast inequality checks
of boolean combinations of constraints, and an exact
subsumption check for representations of two
configurations.\par
These techniques are integrated within a model checker for
universal CTL. Technically, it deals with discrete-time hybrid
systems with linear differentials. The paper presents the
approach, its prototype implementation, and first experimental
data.},

	Abstract = {Reasoning can be defined as the process of applying existing
knowledge in order to produce new knowledge. In logic, there are at least two
fundamentally different sorts of reasoning: the deductive and the abductive.

Deductive reasoning (or simply deduction) is the process of deriving
consequences from what is known or assumed to be true. On the other
hand, abductive reasoning (or simply abduction) infers what needs to be assumed
to derive a given consequence. Thus, deduction
and abduction differ in the direction in which a rule has been used
for inference.

In this work, we present a calculus to generate abductive
explanations for propositional theories. The formalism is based on
propositional resolution with Set-Of-Support strategy. Furthermore,
we investigate an extension of this calculus dealing with orderings.

the splitting rule, which is based on explicit case analysis on variable-

we extend the SUP(LA) calculus with an additional inference rule,

	Abstract = {This paper discusses the analysis of first-order probabilistic
timed automata (FPTA) by a combination of hierarchic first-order
superposition-based theorem proving and probabilistic model checking.
We develop the overall semantics of FPTAs and prove soundness and
completeness of our method for reachability properties. Basically, we decompose
FPTAs into their time plus first-order logic aspects on the one
hand, and their probabilistic aspects on the other hand. Then we exploit
the time plus first-order behavior by hierarchic superposition over
linear arithmetic. The result of this analysis is the basis for the construction
of a reachability equivalent (to the original FPTA) probabilistic
timed automaton to which probabilistic model checking is finally applied.
The hierarchic superposition calculus required for the analysis is
sound and complete on the first-order formulas generated from FPTAs.
It even works well in practice. We illustrate the potential behind it with
a real-life DHCP protocol example, which we analyze by means of tool
chain support.},

	Abstract = {Public business processes can be very complex. That makes it hard for citizens 
to understand these processes and for software companies to implement them into 
software tools. Changes of the process entail expensive effort in both teaching 
the citizens and adapting the software. For business processes several 
model-based approaches have been suggested to deal with high complexity, such 
as BPMN. However, modelling simplifies work of software developers rather than 
of citizens. We present an approach where an adequate user-interface with 
user-centric pertinent information is derived directly from the models. Our 
approach combines the advantages of having models for the software developers 
with the requirements of the users.

The modelling technique we are using is Event-driven Process Chains (EPCs). 
EPCs are widely accepted in the commercial area and are comprehensively 
investigated in the academic area as well. Due to their graphical description 
they are easy to understand. EPCs are implemented in the ARIS toolset, which 
offers the possibility to attach attributes to the elements of the EPCs. This 
paper will demonstrate how these attributes are used to derive a 
user-interface, e.g. a relevant website or document, for each state or 
transition of the EPC. The tools used extract the values of the attributes and 
incorporate them into a web-based user-interface according to the EPC of the 
modelled business process. Execution of the model then is equivalent to running 
the user-interface. A change of the process requires a change of the model 
only, which is much easier to handle than changing the implementation of the 
user-interface.},

They rely on a novel organization of the underlying saturation-based proof 
procedure into a system architecture. As is known, the saturation process tends 
to quickly fill the memory available unless preventive measures are employed. 
To overcome this problem, our new ``\textsc{Waldmeister} loop'' features a 
highly compact representation of the search state, exploiting its inherent 
structure. The implementation just being available, the cost and the benefits 
of the concept now can exactly be measured. Indeed are our expectations met 
concerning the drastic cut-down of memory usage with only moderate overhead of 
time.

In addition it has turned out that the revealed structure of the search state 
paves the way to an easily implemented parallelization of the prover with 
modest communication requirements and rewarding speed-ups. In order to minimize 
communication-related latencies, we discuss some variations of the loop to 
maximally profit from multiple processors.},

the title; they are the subject of a debate on ``big engines vs.\ little 
engines of proof''. The contributions in this thesis advocate that these two 
strands of research can interplay in subtle and sometimes unexpected ways, such 
that mutual pervasion can lead to intriguing results: Firstly, superposition 
can be run on top of decision procedures. This we demonstrate for the class of 
Shostak theories, incorporating a little engine into a big one. As another 
instance of decision procedures within superposition, we show that ground 
confluent rewrite systems, which decide entailment problems in equational 
logic, can be harnessed for detecting redundancies in superposition 
derivations. Secondly, superposition can be employed as proof-theoretic means 
underneath combined decision procedures: We re-establish the correctness of the 
Nelson-Oppen procedure as an instance of the completeness of superposition. 
Thirdly, superposition can be used as a decision procedure for many interesting 
theories, turning a big engine into a little one. For the theory of bits and of 
fixed-size bitvectors, we suggest a rephrased axiomatization combined with a 
transformation of conjectures, based on which superposition decides the 
universal fragment. Furthermore, with a modification of lifting, we adapt 
superposition to the theory of bounded domains and give a decision procedure, 
which captures the Bernays-Sch\"onfinkel class as well.},

logic theories represented by sets of clauses. A satisfiable theory, saturated 
by superposition, implicitly defines a minimal term-generated model for the 
theory.
Proving universal properties with respect to a saturated theory directly leads 
to a modification of the minimal model's term-generated domain, as new Skolem 
functions are introduced. For many applications, this is not desired.

Therefore, we propose the first superposition calculus that can explicitly 
represent existentially quantified variables and can thus compute with respect 
to a given domain. This calculus is sound and refutationally complete in the 
limit for a first-order fixed domain semantics.
For saturated Horn theories and classes of positive formulas, we can even

	Abstract = {Superposition is an established decision procedure for a variety of first-order 
logic theories represented by sets of clauses. A satisfiable theory, saturated 
by superposition, implicitly defines a minimal Herbrand model for the theory. 
This raises the question in how far superposition calculi can be employed for 
reasoning about such minimal models. This is indeed often possible when 
existential properties are considered. However, proving universal properties 
directly leads to a modification of the minimal model's term-generated domain, 
as new Skolem functions are introduced. For many applications, this is not 
desired because it changes  the problem.

In this thesis, I propose the first superposition calculus that can explicitly 
represent existentially quantified variables and can thus compute with respect 
to a given fixed domain. It does not eliminate existential variables by 
Skolemization, but handles them using additional constraints with which each 
clause is annotated. This calculus is sound and refutationally complete in the 
limit for a fixed domain semantics. For saturated Horn theories and classes of 
positive formulas, the calculus is even complete for proving properties of the 
minimal model itself, going beyond the scope of known superposition-based 
approaches.

The calculus is applicable to every set of clauses with equality and does not 
rely on any syntactic restrictions of the input. Extensions of the calculus 
lead to various new decision procedures for minimal model validity. A main 
feature of these decision procedures is that even the validity of queries 
containing one quantifier alternation can be decided. In particular, I prove 
that the validity of any formula with at most one quantifier alternation is 
decidable in models represented by a finite set of atoms and that the validity 
of several classes of such formulas is decidable in models represented by 
so-called disjunctions of implicit generalizations. Moreover, I show that the 
decision of minimal model validity can be reduced to the superposition-based 
decision of first-order validity for models of a class of predicative Horn 
clauses where all function symbols are at most unary.},

(2004) are investigated to automatically derive loop invariants expressing 
weakly relational numerical properties (such as $l \le x \le h$ or $l \le \pm x

Such properties have been successfully used to analyze commercial software 
consisting of hundreds of thousands of lines of code (using for example, the 
Astr\'ee tool based on abstract interpretation framework proposed by Cousot and 
his group). 
The main attraction of the proposed approach is its much lower
complexity in contrast to the abstract interpretation approach ($O(n^2)$ in 
contrast to $O(n^4)$, where $n$ is the number of variables) with the ability to 
still generate invariants of comparable strength.
This approach has been generalized to consider disjunctive invariants of the 
similar form, expressed using maximum function (such as $\max(x+a,y+b,z+c,d) 
\le \max(x+e,y+f,z+g,h)$), thus enabling automatic generation of a subclass of

to decision procedures for many decidable fragments of first-order logic. In 
case of termination without generating an empty clause, a saturated clause set 
implicitly represents a minimal model for all clauses, based on the underlying

whether a ground atom, a clause or even a formula holds in this minimal model

We extend our superposition calculus for fixed domains with syntactic

is a program for hierarchical reasoning in extensions of logical theories with 
additional functions axiomatized by a set of (universally quantified) clauses: 
deduction problems in the theory extension are reduced to deduction problems 
in the base theory. Specialized provers, as well as standard SMT solvers, are 
then used for testing the satisfiability of the formulae obtained after the 
reduction. The hierarchical reduction used in H-PILoT is always sound; it 
is complete for the class of so-called local extensions of a base theory.

the base theory, H-PILoT provides a decision procedure for testing 
satisfiability of ground formulae w.r.t.\ a theory extension, and can also 
be used for model generation. This is the major advantage of  H-PILoT compared 
with other state-of-the art SMT solvers. H-PILoT can alternatively be used as 
a tool for ``steering'' the instantiation mechanism of standard SMT provers,

	Abstract = {\section*{Abstract}


Verification problems are often expressed in a language which mixes several 
theories. 
A natural question to ask is whether one can use decision procedures for 
individual theories to construct a decision procedure for the union theory. 
In the cases where this is possible one has a powerful method at hand to handle 
complex theories effectively.

The setup considered in this thesis is that of one base theory which is 
extended by one or more  theories.
The question is if and when a given ground satisfiability problem in the 
extended setting can be 
effectively reduced to an equi-satisfiable 
problem 
over the base theory. A case where this reductive approach is always possible 
is that of so-called \emph{local theory extensions.}

The theory of  local  extensions is developed and some applications concerning 
monotone functions are given.
Then the theory of local theory extensions is generalized in order to deal with 
data structures that
exhibit local behavior.
It will be shown that a suitable fragment of both the theory of arrays and the 
theory of pointers 
is local in this broader sense.
%
Finally, the case of more than one theory extension is discussed.
In particular, a \emph{modularity} result is given that under certain 
circumstances the locality of each of the extensions
lifts to locality of the entire extension.

The reductive approach outlined above has become particularly relevant
in recent years due to the rise of powerful solvers for background
theories common in verification tasks.  These so-called SMT-solvers
effectively handle theories such as real linear or integer arithmetic.
As part of this thesis, a program called \emph{\mbox{H-PILoT}} was
implemented which carries out reductive reasoning for local theory
extensions. H-PILoT found applications in mathematics, multiple-valued
logics, data-structures and reasoning in complex systems.

unification in the extensions, a class of Horn clause sets called sorted
shallow equational theories is introduced. This class is a natural extension of 
tree automata with equality constraints between brother subterms as
well as shallow sort theories. We show that saturation under sorted

semi-linear equational theories can be effectively transformed into equivalent

To generate efficient code, one wants to statically decide whether or not

We formalize the notion of consecutivity and algorithmically reduce the static

We introduce a preprocessing technique on these SMT problems, which makes it

Nevertheless, in this paper we show that a particular combination

of undecidability, resulting in ``unknown'' answers by
the NLA reasoning procedure. A pipeline
of NLA constraint simplification techniques related to
the SUP(NLA) framework significantly decreases the number of ``unknown''

The resulting approach is implemented as SUP(NLA) by a system combination
of SPASS and iSAT. Applied to various scenarios
of traffic collision avoidance protocols, we show by experiments
that SPASS(iSAT) can fully automatically proof and disproof safety
properties of such protocols using the very same formalization.},

elimination. In the positive case we furthermore derive the defining 
first-order formulas corresponding to our new description. In the negative case 
we can produce sample points establishing a counterexample for the uniqueness. 
We demonstrate our method by automatically proving uniqueness theorems for 
characterizations of several geometric primitives and simple complex objects. 
Finally, we focus on tori, characterizations of which can be applied in spline 
approximation theory with toric segments. Although we cannot yet practically 
solve the fundamental open questions in this area within reasonable time and

some properties that allow it to be used in the context

it correlates better with the size of terms, but the KBO
cannot be used in the afore-mentioned situations, in
which a single term should supersede infinitely many
smaller terms of arbitrary sizes. In this diploma

overcome these limitations. The first extension order is

	Abstract = {Many problems in mathematics and computer science 
(e.g. in verification, or when reasoning in and about 
distributed databases) can be reduced to proving the
satisfiability of conjunctions of (ground) literals modulo 
a background theory. This theory can, for instance, be the
extension of a base theory with additional functions or a
combination of theories.
It is therefore very important to find efficient methods for 
checking the unsatisfiability of ground formulae in such 
complex theories. However, it is often equally important 
to find local causes for inconsistency. Such information is
usually provided by interpolants. 
 
In this paper we study interpolation in local extensions of a 
base theory ${\cal T}_0$. In such extensions efficient 
hierarchical reasoning -- in which a prover for the base theory
is used as a black box -- is possible. 
We identify situations in which it is possible to obtain 
interpolants in a hierarchical manner, by using a prover 
and a procedure for generating interpolants in ${\cal T}_0$ 
as `black-boxes' in order to generate interpolants in the 
extension.

We provide several examples of such theories, and discuss 
their applications in verification or knowledge representation.},

	Abstract = {We study possibilities of reasoning about extensions of base 
theories with functions which satisfy certain recursion and 
homomorphism properties. Our focus is on emphasizing 
possibilities of hierarchical and modular reasoning in such 
extensions and combinations thereof.

\begin{itemize}
\item[(1)] We show that the theory of absolutely free 
constructors is local, and locality is preserved also in the 
presence of selectors. These results are consistent with 
existing decision procedures for this theory (e.g. by Oppen).

\item[(2)] We show that, under certain assumptions, extensions 
of the theory of absolutely free constructors with functions 
satisfying a certain type of recursion axioms satisfy locality 
properties, and show that for functions with values in an 
ordered domain we can combine recursive definitions with 
boundedness axioms without sacrificing locality. We also address 
the problem of only considering models whose data part is
the {em initial} term algebra of such theories.

\item[(3)] We analyze conditions which ensure that similar 
results can be obtained if we relax some assumptions about the 
absolute freeness of the underlying theory of data types, and 
illustrate the ideas on an example from cryptography.
\end{itemize}

The locality results we establish allow us to reduce the task of 
reasoning about the class of recursive functions we consider to 
reasoning in the underlying theory of data structures (possibly 
combined with the theories associated with the co-domains of 
the recursive functions).

As a by-product, the methods we use provide a possibility of 
presenting in a different light (and in a different form) 
locality phenomena studied in cryp-to-gra-phy; we believe that
they will allow to better separate rewriting from proving, and 
thus to give simpler proofs. },

-------------------

Abstract: 

The applications of algebra and logic in computer science are
particularly abundant nowadays; in fact logic is often called
"the calculus of computer science".  On the other hand, the
development of computer science has a strong impact on the
research in algebra and logic, and in particular on the research
in computational mathematics and automated theorem proving.

\smallskip
In this talk I will present two, strongly interrelated, directions
of my recent research, which reflect some of the links between
algebra, logic and computer science emphasized above:

\begin{itemize}
\item Decompositions of algebraic structures in terms of simpler
   structures, and applications to automated theorem proving.

\item A study of interaction in complex systems, and applications
   to modular checking of certain properties of systems obtained
   by composing simpler systems.
\end{itemize}

Abstract:

One of the most important problems in computer science is to 
identify decidable and tractable fragments of (first- or 
higher-order) logic, and to develop efficient deductive 
calculi for these fragments.
However, in most real-life applications it is necessary to 
consider combinations of theories which are, usually, 
extensions of a shared base theory. 
Two important questions arise in this context:

\begin{itemize}
\item Assume that we have a complete prover for a logical theory.
    Can one use this prover as a ``black-box'' to prove theorems
    in an extension of the theory?

\item Assume that we have complete provers for two theories.
    Can we obtain a complete prover for their combination,
    by using the provers of the components as ``black-boxes''?
\end{itemize}

In this talk we present several situations in which hierarchical 
and modular reasoning is possible, and point out similarities 
and differences between various approaches to modular theorem
proving in combinations of logical theories.},

@misc{Sofronie-Stokkermans-tutorial-ki08,
	Abstract = {One of the most important objectives of the research in mathematics and 
computer science is to obtain means of reasoning in and about complex systems. 
These can be, for instance complex mathematical theories; programs, or 
generally reactive or hybrid systems; distributed databases; or complex systems 
in general (e.g. multi-agent systems or reactive or hybrid systems with 
embedded software, whose behavior is controlled by databases, reasoning about 
knowledge and belief, planning mechanisms, or programs). Proving that such 
systems have certain properties (e.g. that they are safe, that they behave 
correctly, or that the information they use does not contain inconsistencies) 
is extremely important: In safety-critical systems (such as cars, trains, 
planes, or power-plants) even small mistakes can provoke disasters. Since the 
amount of data which has to be handled in verification tasks is usually huge, 
computer support is indispensable. The dream of the scientists is to provide 
such correctness proofs automatically. This goal cannot be reached in its full 
generality: As shown by undecidability results going back to the work of G{\"o}del, 
Church and Turing, it is impossible to write a program for checking arbitrary 
properties of general systems. However, for concrete application domains, 
automatic procedures exist. It is therefore very important to identify 
situations in which automated verification of complex systems is possible. For 
this, it is essential to identify theories which are decidable, preferably with 
low complexity, and - since concrete problems often are quite heterogeneous in 
nature - to obtain methods for efficiently combining decision procedures.

The goal of the tutorial is to give a comprehensive, in-depth perspective of 
recent advances in the field of reasoning in complex logical theories, and to 
present applications of these results in various areas ranging from formal 
verification to reasoning about knowledge. The tutorial introduces the general 
principles underlying reasoning in complex theories from a unifying 
perspective, gives a survey of recent achievements in the field, and 
illustrates the problems and their solutions using a selection of examples from 
mathematics, verification, and knowledge representation.},

This is achieved by using a structure-preserving

The satisfiability check can then be performed 
either by a resolution-based theorem prover or 
by a SAT checker.  We apply the method to 
unification with free constants and to unification

in fact, it yields a decision procedure for the positive

	Abstract = {In this paper we give a method for automated theorem proving in the universal 
theory of certain varieties of distributive lattices with well-behaved 
operators. For this purpose, we use extensions of Priestley's representation 
theorem for distributive lattices. We first establish a link between 
satisfiability of universal sentences with respect to varieties of distributive 
lattices with operators and satisfiability with respect to certain classes of 
relational structures. We then use these results for giving a method for 
translation to clause form of universal sentences in such varieties, and obtain 
decidability and complexity results for the universal theory of some such 
varieties. The advantage is that we avoid the explicit use of the full 
algebraic structure of such lattices, instead using sets endowed with a 
reflexive and transitive relation and with additional functions and relations. 
We  first studied this type of relationships in the context of finitely-valued 
logics and then extended the ideas to more 

general non-classical logics. This  paper shows that the idea is much more 
general. In particular, the method presented here subsumes both existing 
methods for translating modal logics to classical logic and methods for 
automated theorem proving in finitely-valued logics based on distributive 
lattices with operators. },

	Abstract = {Many problems in mathematics and computer science can be
reduced to proving the satisfiability of conjunctions of 
literals in a background theory which is often the extension 
of a base theory with additional functions or a combination 
of theories.
It is therefore important to have efficient procedures for 
checking satisfiability of conjunctions of ground literals 
in extensions and combinations of theories.
For a special type of theory extensions, namely {\em local 
extensions},  hierarchic reasoning, in which a theorem prover 
for the base theory can be used as a ``black box'',  
is possible. Many theories used in computer science or 
mathematics are local extensions of a base theory.
However, often it is necessary to consider complex extensions 
of a theory, with various types of functions.

In this paper we identify situations in which
a combination of local extensions of a base theory 
is guaranteed to be again a local extension of the base theory.
We thus obtain criteria both for recognizing wider classes of 
local theory extensions, and for modular reasoning in 
combinations of theories over non-disjoint signatures.},

	Abstract = {The main goal of this paper is to give a better understanding of 
existing many-valued resolution procedures, and thus help to improve 
the efficiency of automated theorem proving in finitely-valued logics. 
First, we briefly present a method for translation to clause form 
in finitely-valued logics based on distributive lattices with operators, 
which uses the Priestley dual of the algebra of truth values.
We show that the unsatisfiability of the set of signed clauses thus 
obtained can be checked by a version of signed negative hyperresolution. 
This extends the results established by H\"ahnle in the case of regular logics,
where the set of truth values is linearly ordered. As in the case of regular 
hyperresolution, also our version of signed hyperresolution is surprisingly 
similar to the classical version. In the second part of the paper we explain 
why regular logics and the logics we consider are so well-behaved.
We show that in both cases the translation to clause form  is actually a
translation to classical logic, and that soundness and completeness of various
refinements of the (signed) resolution procedure follow as a consequence of 
results from first-order logic. Decidability and complexity results for signed
clauses follow as well, by using results from first-order logic. This explains
and extends earlier results on theorem proving in finitely-valued logics.},

	Abstract = {This paper introduces a new decision procedure for PLTL based on labelled 
superposition.
Its main idea is to treat temporal formulas as infinite sets of purely 
propositional clauses over an extended signature. These infinite sets are then 
represented by finite sets of labelled propositional clauses. The new 
representation enables the  replacement of the complex temporal resolution 
rule, suggested by existing resolution calculi for PLTL, by a fine grained 
repetition check of finitely saturated labelled clause sets followed by a 
simple inference. The completeness argument is based on the standard model 
building idea from superposition. It inherently justifies ordering 
restrictions, redundancy elimination and effective partial model building. The 
latter can be directly used to effectively generate counterexamples of 
non-valid PLTL conjectures out of saturated labelled clause sets in a 
straightforward way.},

	Abstract = {We give a method for extending efficient SMT solvers to handle quantifiers, 
using Superposition inference rules. In our method, the input formula is 
converted into CNF as in traditional first order logic theorem provers. The 
ground clauses are given to the SMT solver, which runs a DPLL method to build 
partial models. The partial model is passed to a Congruence Closure procedure, 
as is normally done in SMT. Congruence Closure calculates all reduced 
(dis)equations in the partial model and passes them to a Superposition 
procedure, along with a justification. The Superposition procedure then 
performs an inference rule, which we call Justified Superposition, between the 
(dis)equations and the nonground clauses, plus usual Superposition rules with 
the nonground clauses. Any resulting ground clauses are provided to the DPLL 
engine. We prove the completeness of this method, using a nontrivial 
modification of Bachmair and Ganzinger's model generation technique. We believe 
this combination uses the best of both worlds, an SMT process to handle ground 
clauses efficiently, and a Superposition procedure which uses orderings to 
handle the nonground clauses.},

	Abstract = {Order-sorted specifications (i.e., many-sorted specifications with subsort 
relations) have been proved to be a useful tool for the description of 
partially defined functions and error handling in abstract data types. \par 
Several definitions for order-sorted algebras have been proposed. In some 
papers an operator symbol, which may be multiply declared, is interpreted by a 
family of functions (``overloaded'' algebras), in other papers it is always 
interpreted by a single function (``non-overloaded'' algebras). On the one 
hand, we try to demonstrate the differences between these two approaches with 
respect to equality, rewriting, and completion; on the other hand, we prove 
that in fact both theories can be studied parallelly, provided that certain 
notions are suitably defined. \par The overloaded approach differs from the 
many-sorted and the non-overloaded case, in that the overloaded term algebra is 
not necessarily initial. We give a decidable sufficient criterion for the 
initiality of the term algebra, which is less restrictive than GJM-regularity 
as proposed by Goguen, Jouannaud, and Meseguer. \par Sort decreasingness is an 
important property of rewrite system, since it ensures that confluence and 
Church-Rosser property are equivalent, that the overloaded and non-overloaded 
rewrite relations agree, and that variable overlaps do not yield critical 
pairs. We prove that it is decidable whether or not a rewrite rule is sort 
decreasing, even if the signature is not regular. \par Finally we demonstrate 
that every overloaded completion procedure may also be used in the 
non-overloaded world, but not conversely, and that specifications exist that 
can only be completed using the non-overloaded semantics.},

A sort may denote an empty set and the sort structure can be created by making use of the full first-order language. Technically spoken, we allow sort declarations to be used in the same way than ordinary atoms. Therefore we can compile every first-order logic formula into our logic.\\ The extended expressivity implies an extended sorted inference machine. We present a new unification algorithm and show that the declarations the unification algorithm is built on have to be changed dynamically during the deduction process. Deductions in the resulting resolution calculus are very efficient compared to deductions in the unsorted resolution calculus. The approach is a conservative extension of the known sorted approaches, as it simplifies to the known sorted calculi if we apply the calculus to the much more restricted input formulas of these calculi.},

Literals built from one place predicates are called sort literals. Negative sort literals can be compiled into restrictions of the relevant variables to sorts or can be deleted if they fulfill special conditions. Positive sort literals define the sort structure for sorted unification. Sorted unification exploits the sort restrictions of variables. As the occurrence of sort literals is not restricted, it might be necessary to add additional literals to resolvents and factors and to dynamically change the set of positive sort literals used by sorted unification during the deduction process. The calculus I propose thus extends the standard resolution method by sorted unification, residue literals and a dynamic processing of the sort information. I show that this calculus generalizes and improves existing approaches to sorted reasoning. Finally I give some applications to automated theorem proving and abduction.},

Semantically, the domain of a variable is restricted to the intersection of the denotations of the attached predicates. Syntactically, the sort information is exploited by modified $\gamma$ and $\delta$ rules. The standard unification algorithm of free variable tableau is replaced by a sorted unification algorithm. The resulting calculi, tableau with sorts and free variable tableau with sorts are proved sound, complete and more suitable for mechanization than their counterparts without sorts.},

	Abstract = {
First-order theorem proving with equality is undecidable, in general. 
However, it
is semi-decidable in the sense that it is refutationally complete. The 
basis for a
(semi)-decision procedure for first-order clauses with equality is a 
calculus composed
of inference and reduction rules. The inference rules of the calculus 
generate
new clauses whereas the reduction rules delete clauses or transform them 
into simpler
ones. If, in particular, strong reduction rules are available, 
decidability of
certain subclasses of first-order logic can be shown. Hence, 
sophisticated reductions
are essential for progress in automated theorem proving. In this thesis we
consider the superposition calculus and in particular the sophisticated 
reduction
rule Contextual Rewriting. However, it is in general undecidable whether 
contextual
rewriting can be applied. Therefore, to make the rule applicable in 
practice,
it has to be further refined. In this work we develop an instance of 
contextual
rewriting which effectively performs contextual rewriting and we 
implement this
in the theorem prover Spass.},

@mastersthesis{Zimmer2007,
	Abstract = {First-order logic combined with arithmetic background theories is a
powerful tool for representing and managing huge amounts of
declarative information. Special fragments of it were successfully
applied to manifold problems from different areas of computer
science. From an automated reasoning perspective, however, this
expressiveness makes it particular challenging to develop theorem
provers that can deal with general classes of those languages:
General purpose theorem provers on the one hand cannot cope
efficiently with arithmetic and specialized decision procedures on
the other hand are notoriously bad at dealing with quantifiers, if
they are even supported at all.

The SPASS+T system, which was developed by Prevosto and Waldmann,
aims to attack this problem by combining the superposition-based
theorem prover SPASS with decision procedures for linear arithmetic
and free function symbols; furthermore, the set of standard
first-order inference and reduction rules is complemented by
specialized rules for arithmetic.

In this work we present various extensions to their initial
implementation. The main task of the thesis was to stretch the
capabilities of the system by integrating the SPASS splitting rule,
which had to be switched off so far. Splitting is highly efficient
for SPASS and has also advantages in a combination like SPASS+T. In
order to add support for splitting in SPASS+T we first revised the
previous system architecture and developed an advanced coupling
between SPASS and the SMT procedure and achieved a tighter
integration of the latter in form of a new inference rule.
Furthermore, for splitting a careful analysis of the different
prover configurations was necessary. Besides splitting, the new
coupling also allows to use the SPASS proof documentation mode
regarding subproofs that were contributed by the SMT procedure. The
documented proofs can be automatically certified. To this end we
extended the existing SPASS proof validator in such a way that it
also employs an external SMT procedure and now can verify, besides
ordinary first-order proof steps, arithmetic inferences as well. In
order to improve the built-in arithmetic simplification rules of
SPASS+T and let them also work with bignums and rational numbers, we
integrated the GNU multiple precision library. Finally, we added a
new reduction rule that deals with clauses which impose lower or
upper bounds on a variable.

We will describe all these extensions in detail, discuss their
impact on the system architecture, and demonstrate the capabilities
of the system by applying it to some examples.},
