<h4>FLEA &ndash; bit(e)s and pieces</h4> 

<p>
FLEA is a upcoming first-order theorem prover with equality. 
For an unsatisfiable set of (non-ground) clauses it will eventually find a
unsatisfiable set of ground instances of those clauses.

Satisfiability checking modulo equality logic with uninterpreted functions
is utilized to confirm (un-)satisfiability of ground clauses and to guide the 
search for relevant instances of clauses.
