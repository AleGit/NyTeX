\subsection{Provability}

In general a proof may be a finite sequence of proof steps from premises via intermediate statements to a final, i.e.~the proven statement. 
A formal proof system is a collection of rules, that describes permissible proof steps  mostly in the same terminology as the to be proven statements.
