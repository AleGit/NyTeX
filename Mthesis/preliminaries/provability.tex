\subsection{Provability}

In general a proof may be a finite sequence of proof steps
from none or some premises via intermediate statements
to a final, the then proven statement.
A formal proof system or logical calculus describes admissible basic proof steps
in the underlying logic of the statements, in our case first order logic.
A formal proof comprises only proof steps confirmed by rules of the applied logical calculus.

\input{definitions/NaturalDeduction}

\begin{definition}A sentence in first order logic is \coloremph{provable}
	if their exists a proof in a formal proof system for first order logic,
	e.g.~natural deduction.
	We write
	\( F_1, \ldots, F_n \proves G \)
	when we can prove \(G\) from premises \( F_1,\ldots,F_n \).
\end{definition}

A natural deduction proof starts with a (possible empty) set of sentences --- the premises ---
and infer other sentences --- the conclusions --- by applying the syntactic proof inference rules.
A box must be opened for each assumption, e.g.~a term or a sentence.
Closing the box discards the assumption and all its conclusions within the box{(es)},
but may introduce a derived sentence outside the box{(es)}.
Then \( F_1,\ldots,F_n \proves H \) claims that \( H \)
is outside of any box
and has been inferred (via a finite set of intermediate formulae)
from \( \{ F_1,\ldots,F_n\} \).

\begin{example}We show \( \forall x (\mP(x)\land\lnot\mQ(x)) \proves \forall x(\lnot\mQ(x)\land\mP(x)) \) with natural deduction.
	We note our premise (1), we open a box and assume an arbitrary fresh constant (2),
	we create a ground instance of our premise with quantifier elimination and the constant (3),
	we extract the literals with both variants of conjunction elimination (4, 5),
	we introduce a conjunction of the ground literals (6),
	and close the box to introduce the universally quantified conjunction (7).
