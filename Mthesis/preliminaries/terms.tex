\begin{definition}\label{def:terms}
	We build the set of {\myem terms }$\mcTf = \mcTFfV$ 
	from function symbols and a
	countable set of {\myem variables }$\mcV$ disjoint from $\mcF$\!.
	Every variable $x\in\mcV$ is a term,
	every constant $c\in\mcFf^{(0)}$ is a term, 
	and with $n>0$ every expression $f(t_1,\ldots,t_n)$
	for every function symbol $f\in\mcFfn$ 
	and terms $t_1,\ldots,t_n$
	is a term.
