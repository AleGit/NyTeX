\begin{definition}
	We build the set of (function) {\myem terms} $\mcTfFV$ 
	from function symbols $\mcFf \subseteq \mcF$ and 
	a countable set of {\myem variables} $\mcV$ disjoint from $\mcF$.
	Every variable $x\in\mcV$ is a term,
	every constant $c\in\mcFf^{(0)}$ is a term, 
	and every expression $f(t_1,\ldots,t_n)$
	for every function symbol $f\in\mcFf$ 
	with arity $n>0$ 
	and terms $t_1,\ldots,t_n$
	is a term.
%	
	We build the set of predicate terms or {\myem atoms} $\mcTPFV$
	from predicate symbols $\mcFP \subseteq \mcF$ and terms $t\in\mcTfFV$. 
	Every proposition $p\in\mcFP^{(0)}$ is an atom 
	and every expression $P(t_1,\ldots,t_n)$
	for every predicate symbol $P\in\mcFP$ with arity $n>0$ and terms $t_1,\ldots,t_n$ is an atom.
%	Every equation $s\ \mEQ\ t$ for terms $s,t$ is an atom too.
%
%	We speak of the set of general terms 
%	$\mcTFV = \mcTfFV\disjointunion\mcTPFV$ as the disjoint union of terms and atoms.
