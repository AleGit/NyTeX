\section{Preliminaries}

We assume familiarity with propositional and predicate logic \cite{Huth:2004:LCS:975331}, 
automated theorem proving \cite{Fitting:1996:FLA:230183}, 
term rewriting \cite{Baader:1998:TR:280474}, 
decision procedures \cite{Kroening:2008:DPA:1391237}, 
and (maximum) satisfiability testing \cite{Biere:2009:HSV:1550723}.
Even so, for clarity we introduce
definitions and state lemmas and theorems without proofs.
Notions and notations follow (with small deviations) the lecture notes \cite{AM2015tr} and \cite{GM2013ar}.
This section is mostly an extension of the same section in our seminar report \cite{axm:SR2}.

In examples we usually use $\ma,\mb,\mc,\md$ for constants $c\in\mcFf^{(0)}$,
$\mf,\mg,\mh$ for function symbols $f\in\mcFf^{(>0)}$,
$\mpp,\mq,\mr$ for propositions $p\in\mcFP^{(0)}$, and 
$\mP,\mQ,\mR$ for predicate symbols $P\in\mcFP^{(>0)}$.
The special binary equality symbol $\mEQ$ is always available.
% and can be seen as special predicate ${\mEQ}\in\mcFP^{(2)}$.
