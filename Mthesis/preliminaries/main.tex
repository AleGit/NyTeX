\chapter{Preliminaries}

\input{epigraphs/defintion}

We assume familiarity with propositional and predicate logic \cite{Huth:2004:LCS:975331}, 
automated theorem proving \cite{Fitting:1996:FLA:230183}, 
term rewriting \cite{Baader:1998:TR:280474}, 
decision procedures \cite{Kroening:2008:DPA:1391237}, 
and (maximum) satisfiability testing \cite{Biere:2009:HSV:1550723}.
Even so, for clarity we introduce basic
definitions and state basic lemmas and theorems without proofs.
Notions and notations follow (with small deviations) the lecture notes \cite{AM2015tr} and \cite{GM2013ar}.
This section is mostly an extension of the same section in our seminar report \cite{axm:SR2}.

%In examples we usually use $\ma,\mb,\mc,\md$ for constants $c\in\mcFfO$,
%$\mf,\mg,\mh$ for function symbols $f\in\mcFfgo$,
%$\mpp,\mq,\mr$ for propositions $p\in\mcFPO$, and 
%$\mP,\mQ,\mR$ for predicate symbols $P\in\mcFPgo$.
%%The special binary equality symbol $\mEQ$ is always available.
%% and can be seen as special predicate ${\mEQ}\in\mcFP^{(2)}$.

\section{Semantics}

\begin{definition}
	An {\myem interpretation} $\mcI$ over a signature $\mcF$ consists 
	of a {\myem universe}, i.e.~non-empty set  $A$,
	the definitions of functions $\mf^\mcI: A^n\rightarrow A$  for every function symbol $\mf\in\mcFf$, 
	and definitions of possibly empty relations $\mEQ^\mcI\subseteq A^2$ for the equality symbol 
	and ${\mP^\mcI}\subseteq A^n$ for every predicate symbol $\mP\in\mcFP$.
%	
	An {\myem equational} interpretation interprets the equality symbol as equality on its domain.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{def:termmodel}
	%A ground literal $L$ holds in an Herbrand {\myem interpretation} $\mathcal I$ (a domain of ground terms and definitions for functions and predicates), 
	%if it is the logical consequence $\mathcal I\models L$ of ground literals in $\mathcal I$.
	%A non-ground literal holds in $\mathcal I$, if all its ground instances hold in $\mathcal I$.
	%A clause holds in $\mathcal I$, if at least one of its literals holds in $\mathcal I$.
	%A set of clauses $S$ holds in $\mathcal I$, if every clause $\mathcal C\in S$ holds in $\mathcal I$.
	%An interpretation is consistent $\mathcal I\not\models\square$, if no pair of complementary literals holds in $\mathcal I$.
	%A set of clauses $S$ is {\myem satisfiable} if it has a {\myem model} $\mathcal M$, i.e.~a consistent interpretation $\mathcal M\models S$.
	A {\myem Herbrand interpretation}  $\mcH$ is an interpretation where the elements of the domain are ground terms
	and the interpretation of each ground term $t^\mcH := t$ is the term itself.
	A {\myem term interpretation} $\mcM$ is an equational interpretation where the elements of the domain $A$ 
	are equivalence classes of ground terms
	and the interpretation of each ground term $t^\mcM := [t]_\sim$ is its equivalence class.
	An equation $s\mEQ t$ of ground terms holds in $\mcM$ if $[s]_\sim=[t]_\sim$;
	a ground predicate $\mP(t_1,\ldots,t_n)$ holds in $\mcM$ if $\mP([t_1]_\sim,\ldots,[t_n]_\sim)] \in A^n$.
	A ground literal holds in $\mcM$ if and only if its complementary literal does not hold in $\mcM$.
	
	A non-ground literal holds in $\mcM$ if all its 
	%(infinitely many in the presence of function symbols with arity greater than one) 
	(perhaps infinitely many)
	instances hold in $\mcM$.
	A clause holds in $\mcM$, if at least one of its literals holds in $\mcI$.
	A set of clauses $S$ holds in $\mcM$, if every clause $\mcC\in S$ holds in $\mcM$.
	Then we say $\mcM$ is a model {\em for} $S$.
	
\end{definition}

\section{Term Rewriting}

\begin{definition}\label{def:position}
	A {\myem position} is a finite sequence of positive integers.
	The root position is the empty sequence $\epsilon$.
	Position $pq$ is obtained by concatenation of positions $p$ and $q$.
	%
	The set of all positions of a term or literal is defined as 
	\DEFINE{ 
		\pos(\mct) }
	{
		\{ \epsilon \} 		
		& \text{if }\mct = x \in \mcV \\
%		
		\{ \epsilon \} \cup \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} \{ iq\mid q\in\pos(t_i) \}	
		& \text{if }\mct=\mcf(t_1,\ldots,t_n)\text{ where } \mcf\in\mcF^{(n)}.
	}
The~{\myem subterm} $t|_p$ of term $t$ {\myem at position} $p\in\pos(t)$ is defined as
%
\DEFINE{
	t|_p
}{
	t 		& \text{if }p=\epsilon \\
	t_i|_q	& \text{if }t=\mkf(t_1,\ldots,t_n)\text{ and }p=iq
}
%
If $s$ is a term then $t[s]_p$ represents the term build by replacing the subterm of $t$ at position $p$ with the term $s$.
\DEFINE{
	t[s]_p}
{
	s 		& \text{if }p=\epsilon \\
	\mf(t_1,\ldots,t_i[s]_q,\ldots,t_n)	& \text{if }t=\mf(t_1,\ldots,t_n)\text{ and }p=iq
}
%A {\myem hole} denotes a special constant symbol $\ctxhole\in\mcFf^{(0)}$. 
%A {\myem context} is a term $t$ with exactly one hole, i.e.~one occurrence $|t|_{\ctxhole}=1$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	A {\myem rewrite rule} is an equation of terms where the left-hand side is not a variable
	and the variables occuring in the right-hand side occur also in the left-hand side.
	\[
		\ell\rwEQ r \text{ is rewrite rule }\quad :\Longleftrightarrow\quad\ell\not\in\mcV\text{ and }\var(r)\subseteq\var(l)
	\] 
	A rewrite rule $\ell'\rwEQ r'$ is a {\myem variant} of $\ell\rwEQ r$ if there is a renaming $\varrho$
	such that 
	$(l\rightarrow r)\varrho = l'\rightarrow r'$.
	A {\myem term rewrite system} is a set of rewrite rules without variants.
	%
	
	The expression $s\rwRule{p,\ell\rwEQ r\!,\sigma}t$ denotes a {\myem rewrite step} 
	from term $s$ to term $t$
	with 
	a position $p\in\pos(s)$,
	a rewrite rule $l\rightarrow r$,
	and a substitution $\sigma$ such that
	$s|_p=l\sigma$ and $t=s[r\sigma]_p$.
	The subterm $l\sigma$ is called {\myem redex} and
	$s$ rewrites to $t$ by {\myem contracting} $l\sigma$ to {\myem contractum} $r\sigma$.
	%
	We write $s\rightarrow_\mcR t$ when we just claim that $s\rwRule{p,\ell\rwEQ r\!, \sigma}t$ exists and $l\rwEQ r\in\mcR$.
	
	
	%
	A term $s$ is {\myem irreducible} or in {\myem normal form} if there is no rewrite step $s\rightarrow t$ for any term $t$. 
	The set of normal forms $\mNFR$ of a TRS $\mcR$ contains all irreducible terms of the TRS.
	\end{definition}
