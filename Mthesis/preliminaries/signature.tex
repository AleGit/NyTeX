\begin{definition}\label{def:signature}
A {\myem signature} $\mcF=\mcFfP$ is the disjoint union 
of {\myem function symbols} $\mcFf$ 
and {\myem predicate symbols} $\mcFP$.
The {\myem arity} of a symbol is the number of its arguments.
With $\mcFfn$ we denote symbols with arity $n$.
Function symbols $c\in\mcFfO$ with no arguments are called {\myem constants}.
Predicate symbols $p\in\mcFPO$ with no arguments are called propositions. 
\end{definition}
