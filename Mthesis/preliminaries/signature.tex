\begin{definition}\label{def:signature}
A {\myem signature} $\mcF=\mcFfPE$ is the disjoint union 
of {\myem function symbols} $\mcFf$, {\myem predicate symbols} $\mcFP$
and the equality symbol.
The {\myem arity} of a symbol is the number of its arguments.
With $\mcFn$ we denote symbols with arity $n$.
Function symbols $c\in\mcFfO$ with no arguments are called {\myem constants}.
%Predicate symbols $p\in\mcFPO$ with no arguments are called propositions. 
%As usual the arity of the equality symbol is two.
