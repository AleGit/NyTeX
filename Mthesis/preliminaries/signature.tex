\begin{definition}\label{def:signature}
A 
first order 
{\myem signature} with equality
%with equality
$\mcF = \mcFfPE$ 
is the disjoint union of 
{\myem function symbols} $\mcFf$, 
{\myem predicate symbols} $\mcFP$,
and one equality symbol.
%
The {\myem arity} of a symbol determines the number of its successors in a first order expression.
With $\mcFn = \{ \mcf\in\mcF \mid \arity(\mcf) = n \}$ we denote symbols with arity $n$.
