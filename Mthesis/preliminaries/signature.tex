\begin{definition}\label{def:signature}
A
first order
\coloremph{signature} with equality
%with equality
\( \mcF = \mcFfPE \)
is the disjoint union of
a set of \coloremph{function symbols} \( \mcFf \),
a set of \coloremph{predicate symbols} \( \mcFP \),
and one distinct equality symbol.
%
The \coloremph{arity} of a symbol determines the number of its arguments in a first order expression.
With \( \mcFn = \{ \mcf\in\mcF \mid \arity(\mcf) = n \} \) we denote symbols with arity \( n \).
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    We use \( \mEQ \) as equality symbol in our signatures to emphasize
    that at this point it is just a highlighted symbol
    without “meaning”.
    On the other hand we use \( = \) to express “identity” of objects
    like formulae or sets
    without actually defining how this identity can be determined.
\end{remark}
