\begin{definition}\label{def:predicates}
	We build the set of {\myem predicates} $\mcPT$
	from predicate symbols and terms. 
	For every $n\geq 0$ every expression $P(t_1,\ldots,t_n)$
	for every predicate symbol $P\in\mcFPn$ and terms $t_1,\ldots,t_n$ is a predicate.
	The set of {\myem equations }$\mcET$ includes all expressions $s\mEQ t$ for arbitrary terms $s$ and $t$. 
	The set of atomic formulas (or {\myem atoms }for short) is the union of predicates and equations.
