\begin{definition}\label{def:predicates}\label{def:equations}\label{def:atoms}
	We build the set of (first order) {\myem predicates} $\mcPT$
	from predicate symbols and terms.
	Every proposition $\mpp\in \mcFPn[0]$ is a predicate,
	and every expression $\mP(t_1,\ldots,t_n)$ is a predicate for $n>0$,
	predicate symbol $\mP\in\mcFPn$ and arbitrary terms $t_1,\ldots,t_n$.
%
	We build the set of (first order) {\myem equations }$\mcET$ from the equality symbol and terms.
	Every pair $s\mEQ t$ is an equation %\footnote{
%		We use prefix and infix notation interchangeable,
%		e.g.~${\mEQ}(s,t)$ represents the same equation as $s\mEQ t$.}
	for arbitrary terms $s$ and $t$.
%
	The set of atomic formulas (or {\myem atoms} for short) is the (distinct) union of predicates and equations.
