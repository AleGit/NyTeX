\begin{definition}\label{def:predicates}
	We build the set of {\myem predicates} $\mcPT$
	from predicate symbols and terms. 
	Every proposition $p\in \mcFP$ is a predicate, 
	and every expression $P(t_1,\ldots,t_n)$ is a predicate for $n>0$,
	predicate symbol $P\in\mcFPn$ and arbitrary terms $t_1,\ldots,t_n$.
%	
	We build the set of {\myem equations }$\mcET$ from the equality symbol and pairs of terms.
	Every expression $s\mEQ t$ is an equation for arbitrary terms $s$ and $t$.
%	
	The set of atomic formulas (or {\myem atoms }for short) is the union of predicates and equations.
