\begin{definition}\label{def:unifier}
Two terms $s$ and $t$ are {\myem unifiable} if there exists a substitution $\sigma$ such that $s\sigma=t\sigma$.
They are {\myem variants}Â if their most general unifier is a renaming.
The {\myem most general unifier} $\sigma=\mgu(s,t)$ is a unifier such that
for every other unifier $\sigma'$ there exists a substitution $\tau$ such that
$\sigma' = \sigma \tau$.
