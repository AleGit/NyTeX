\begin{definition}\label{def:unifier}
Two first order expressions [\(\mct, \mcu\) are {\myem unifiable} if there exists a {\myem unifier},
i.e.~a substitution $\sigma$ such that $\mct\sigma=\mcu\sigma$.
The {\myem most general unifier} $\mgu(\mct,\mcu)$ is a unifier such that
for every other unifier $\sigma'$ there exists a substitution $\tau$ where
$\sigma' = \sigma \tau$.
Two literals are variants if their most general unifier is a renaming.
Two literals are {\myem clashing} when the first literal
and the complement of the second literal are unifiable,
i.e.~literals $L'$ and $L$ are clashing if $\mgu(L', L^c)$ exists.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
	The unification of quantified formulae remains undefined in this thesis.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
	Literals $\mP(x)$ and $\lnot\mP(\mf(\ma,y))$
	are clashing by unifier $\{ x\mapsto \mf(\ma,y)\}$.
\end{example}
