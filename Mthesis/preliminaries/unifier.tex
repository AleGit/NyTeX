\begin{definition}\label{def:unifier}
Two first order expressions $\mct, \mcu$ are {\myem unifiable} if there exists a substitution $\sigma$ such that $\mct\sigma=\mcu\sigma$.
The {\myem most general unifier} $\mgu(\mct,\mcu)$ is a unifier such that
for every other unifier $\sigma'$ there exists a substitution $\tau$ where
$\sigma' = \sigma \tau$. 
Two literals are variants if their most general unifier is a renaming.
Two literals are {\myem clashing} when the complement of the first literal 
and the unchanged second literal are unifiable, i.e.~$L$ and $L'$ are clashing if $\mgu(L^c, L')$ exists.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
	Literals $\lnot\mP(x)$ and $\mP(\mf(\ma,y))$ 
	are clashing by unifier $\{ x\mapsto \mf(\ma,y)\}$.
\end{example}
