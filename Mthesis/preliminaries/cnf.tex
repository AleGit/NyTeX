\begin{definition}\label{def:literals}
A {\myem literal} $L$ is either an atom $A$ or a negated\footnote{
We usually abbreviate $\lnot(s\mEQ t)$ with $s\mNE t$.
} 
atom $\lnot A$.
%
The {\myem complement } $L^\mcc$ of an atom (positive literal) is the negation of the atom.
The complement of a negated atom (negative literal) is the atom itself. 
%\DEFINE{
%	L^\mcc 
%}{
%	\lnot L & \text{if } L \text{ is an atom} \\
%	A 		& \text{if } L = \lnot A, \text{ the negation of an atom } A
%}
%
A {\myem clause}\ \ $\mcC = L_1\lor\ldots\lor L_n$  is a possible empty multiset of literals 
and is equivalent to a universally quantified disjunction of its literals.
%The {\myem empty clause} $\emptyclause$ expresses a contradiction. 
%
A finite {\myem set of clauses} $S=\{ \mcC_1,\ldots,\mcC_n \}$Â is equivalent to a conjunction of all its clauses.
%
%Two literals are complementary if one is an atom, i.e. a positive literal and the other is the negation of this atom.

\begin{definition}
	We denote
	terms, atoms, and literals as first order expressions.
	We call a first order expression without variables {\myem ground} or {\myem closed}, 
	i.e.~we build our expressions over an empty set of variables.
\end{definition}
