\begin{definition}\label{def:literals}
A {\myem literal} $L$ is either an atom
or the negation of an atom.
%, where $l\not{}\hspace{-0.5mm}\circ$ abbreviates $\lnot(l\circ r)$
%for binary symobl $\circ$.
%A literal is ground if all its terms are ground.
%The complement $L^c$ of a literal $L$ is defined as %with some atom $A$: 
%\[ L^c = \left\{ \begin{array}{rl}
%A & \text{if } L = \lnot A\\
%\lnot A & \text{if } L = A
%\end{array}\right.
%\]
Two literals are complementary if one is an atom and the other is the negation of this atom.
%
A {\myem clause}\ \ $\mcC = L_1\lor\ldots\lor L_n$  is a possible empty multiset of literals 
and is equivalent to the universally quantified disjunction of its literals.
The {\myem empty clause} $\emptyclause$ expresses a contradiction. 
%A clause is ground if all its literals are ground.
A finite {\myem set of clauses} $S=\{ \mcC_1,\ldots,\mcC_n \}$Â 
is equivalent to the conjunction of its clauses.
$S\equiv(\forall\vec{x}_1\mcC_1)\land\ldots\land(\forall\vec{x}_n\mcC_n)$ with 
$\vec{x}_i = \var(\mcC_i)$.
%$\vec{x}_i\cap\vec{x}_j=\emptyclause\lor i=j$.
%A set of clauses is ground if all its clauses are ground.
