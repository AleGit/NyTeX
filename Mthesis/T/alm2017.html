<h4>Completeness of Inst-saturated Sets of First Order Clauses with Equality</h4>

<h4><i>Alexander Maringele</i></h4>

Instantiation-based theorem proving eventually finds a finite set of unsatisfiable ground
instances for any unsatisfiable set of first order clauses (at least in theory).
Satisfiability of ground instances can be effectively decided by a SAT-solver.
<br />
But in general, satisfiability of a finite set of ground instances does not confirm
    the satisfiability of a set of non-ground clauses.
<br />
Unit paramodulation is part of a sound instantiation-based calculus
for first order logic with equality.
The proving procedure may saturate
without generating an unsatisfiable set of ground instances.
We present a completeness proof from the literature.
An Inst-saturated set of non-ground clauses
with satisfiable grounded instances is satisfiable.
