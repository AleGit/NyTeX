In Section \ref{sec:syntax} we have already defined atomic formulae in Definition~\ref{def:atoms},
but we can only build formulae in clausal normal form (\CNF) with Definition~\vref{def:syntax:CNF}.
Now we will define arbitrary first order formulae (\FOF).

\CNF-Syntax Definition~\vref{def:syntax:CNF},
\CNF-Semantics Definition~\vref{def:semantics:CNF},
\FOF-Syntax Definition~\vref{def:syntax:FOF}, and
\FOF-Semantics Definition~\vref{def:semantics:FOF}



We've already defined when an atom holds for an assignment \( \alpha_\mcI \)
in an interpretation \( \mcI \) within Definition \vref{def:model}.
Now we extend these definitions to first order formulae.


%
	Beside the obvious semantically indistinguishable formulae with double negations, conjunctions, and disjunctions
	we have introduced new ones.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \( \forall x F \), \( \exists x F \), and \( F \) are equivalent if \( x\not\in\fvar(F) \).
		We usually omit quantifiers with variables that do not occur free in the subformula.
		\item \( \exists x F \) and \( F \) are not equivalent if \( x\in\fvar(F) \),
		e.g. \( \exists x(x\mNE\ma) \) is satisfiable and \( x\mNE\ma \) isn't.
		\item \( \forall x F \) and \( F \) are equivalent even if \( x\in\fvar(F) \),
		because in both cases we demand that \( F \) holds in all assignments in our model.
		Usually we keep these universal quantifiers in \FOF.

		\item A first order formulae without quantifiers is in \coloremph{clausal form},
		but not necessarily in \CNF, e.g.~a weakened version of symmetry \( (x\mEQ \ma)\limp (\ma\mEQ x) \)
		is equisatisfiable to \( \forall x ((x\mEQ \ma)\limp (\ma\mEQ x)) \)
		and \( \exists a (\forall x ((x\mEQ a)\limp (a\mEQ x)) \).
		\item A proposition \( p \), i.e.~a nullary predicate symbol holds if \( ()\in p_\mcI \subseteq A^0 \).
