\chapter{Additional Definitions}

\input{epigraphs/Menge}

In this chapter we recall some basic notions we have used but not defined in our thesis.
We assume at least an {\myem basic} understanding of sets as described by Georg Cantor in the 19th century. 
However we ignore all paradoxes in {\myem naive} set theory.
Instead we just assume that our sets are definable within a consistent axiomatic 
-- e.g.~Zermalo-Fraenkel -- set theory.
In section \ref{sec:app:maths} we define relations and orders and in
section \ref{sec:app:fol} we derive sets and numbers from general first order terms.
