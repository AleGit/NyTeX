\chapter{Preliminaries}

%\input{epigraphs/defintion}

In this thesis we assume the reader's familiarity with
propositional and first order logic~\cite{Huth:2004:LCS:975331},
%automated theorem proving \cite{Fitting:1996:FLA:230183},
term rewriting (\textsf{TRW})~\cite{Baader:1998:TR:280474},
decision procedures (\textsf{DP})~\cite{Kroening:2008:DPA:1391237},
and satisfiability checking (\textsf{SAT}) modulo theories (\textsf{SMT})~\cite{Biere:2009:HSV:1550723}.
Nevertheless --- for clarity --- we state basic notions and  definitions
of first order logic with equality in Section~\ref{sec:syntax},
introduce basic concepts of first order semantics in Section~\ref{sec:semantics},
and describe basic term rewriting terminology in Section~\ref{sec:termrewriting}.
%This section is an extension of the same section in our seminar report \cite{axm:SR2}
These notions and notations largely follow the lecture notes to term rewriting and automated reasoning~\cite{AM2015tr, GM2013ar}.
% Figure \vref{fig:conventions} in the appendix lists typographical conventions.

%See the appendix for more details and mathematics.

\subsection{Models}

\begin{definition}\label{def:interpretation}
	An \coloremph{interpretation} \( \mcI \)
	over a first order signature \( \mcF \) consists of a
	non-empty set \( A \)
	(i.e.\ the \coloremph{universe} or \coloremph{domain}),
%
	definitions of mappings
	\( \mf_\mcI: A^n\rightarrow A \)
	for every function symbol \( \mf\in\mcFf \),
	and definitions of (possibly empty) \(n\)-ary relations
	 \( {\mP_\mcI}\subseteq A^n \) for every predicate symbol \( \mP\in\mcFP \)
	 and the definition of (possibly empty) binary relation \( {\mEQ_\mcI}\subseteq A^2 \) for the equality symbol.
%
	 A (variable) \coloremph{assignment} is a mapping from variables to elements of the domain.
%
	 We define the \coloremph{evaluation} \( \alpha_\mcI \) of a term \( t \)
	 for an assignment \( \alpha \) and an interpretation \( \mcI \):

	 \begin{gather*}
	 \MDEFINE{\alpha_\mcI(t)
	%  = t_{\alpha_\mcI}
	 }{ll}{
	 	\alpha(x)
	 	&\text{if }t=x\in\mcV \\
	 	\mc_\mcI
	 	&\text{if }t=\mc\in\mcFfn[0]
	 	\\
	 	\mf_\mcI (\alpha_\mcI(t_1),\ldots,\alpha_\mcI(t_n))
	 	&\text{if }t=\mf(t_1,\ldots,t_n), \mf\in\mcFfn[n>0], t_i\in\mcTf
 }
	 \end{gather*}

\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
	The evaluation of ground terms does not depend on variable assignments.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}\label{def:semantics:atoms}
	A predicate \( \mP(t_1,\ldots,t_n) \)
	\coloremph{holds} for assignment~\( \alpha \)
	and interpretation~\( \mcI \)
	if and only if the evaluation of its \(n\)-tuple \(
	\alpha_\mcI(t_1,\ldots,t_n) = (\alpha_\mcI({t_1}),\ldots,\alpha_\mcI({t_n})) \in \mP_\mcI \)
	is an element of the relation \( \mP_\mcI\subseteq A^n \).
	Similarly an equation \( s\mEQ t \)
	holds if \( \alpha_\mcI(s) \mEQ_\mcI \alpha_\mcI(t) \).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	[Semantics of \FOF{}]\label{def:semantics:FOF}
	A universally quantified sentence \( \forall x F \)
	holds in an interpretation if its subformula \( F \) holds for all assignments for \( x \).
	An existentially quantified sentence \( \exists xF \) holds if its subformula \( F \) holds for at least one assignment for \( x \).
	For a given interpretation and predefined assignments for all occurring free variables
	a negation \( \lnot F \) holds if its subformula \( F \) does not hold,
	a disjunction \( F\lor G \) holds if one or both of its subformulae \( F \) or \( G \) hold,
	a conjunction \( F\land G \) holds if both of its subformulae \( F \) and \( G \) hold,
	an implication \( F\limp G \) holds if its first subformula \( F \) does not hold or its second subformula \( F' \) holds (or both).

	\begin{remark}Usually we assume precedences on connectives to omit parentheses
		and apply some conventions to structure the formulae for readability
		without introducing semantic ambiguity.
	\end{remark}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Semantics of \CNF{}]\label{def:semantics:CNF}
	An atom holds in an interpretation if and only if it
	holds with all possible assignments.
	A literal holds if and only if its complement does not hold.
	A clause holds if at least one of its literals holds,
	hence the empty clause \( \square \) does not hold in any interpretation.
	A set of clauses holds if and only if every clause in the set holds.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	A \coloremph{model} \( \mcM \) for a set of clauses \( S \) (for a sentence \( F \))
	is an interpretation that
	\coloremph{satisfies} the set of clauses (the sentence),
	i.e.~the set of clauses (the sentence) holds in that interpretation \( \mcM \).
	We write \( \mcM\models S \) or \( \mcM\models F \).
	% i.e.~the set of clauses (the sentence) holds in this interpretation.

	A set of clauses (a sentence) is \coloremph{satisfiable} if there exists at least one model for it.
	A set of clauses (a sentence) is \coloremph{valid} if and only if every interpretation is a model.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{def:hk}
	The \coloremph{Herbrand universe} for a first order signature \( \mcF \)
	is the smallest set of terms that contains all \( H_{i\geq 0} \) defined inductively as
	\begin{align*}
	H_0 &=
	\left \{
	\begin{array}{ll}
	\{ \, \mc \mid \mc\in\mcFfn[0] \, \}Â 
	&\text{if } \mcFfn[0]\not=\emptyset
	\\
	\{ \, \mc_0 \, \}
	&\text{if } \mcFfn[0]=\emptyset, \mc_0\not\in\mcF
	\end{array}
	\right.
	&
	H'_0 &= H_0
	\\
	H_{k+1} &= \bigcup_{n> 0}
	\{ \, \mf(t_1, \ldots, t_n) \mid{} \mf\in\mcFfn[n],
	t_1, \ldots, t_n \in{} H_k' \, \}
	&
	H'_{k+1} &= H_k \cup{} H'_{k+1}
	\end{align*}

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	An \coloremph{Herbrand interpretation} \( \mcH \) is an interpretation where the domain
	is an Herbrand universe
	and the interpretation of each ground term \( t_\mcH := t \) is the term itself.
\end{definition}





\subsection{Equisatisfiability}

\begin{definition}\label{def:entailment}\label{def:equivalence}
	% [Consequence and entailment]
	A (first order) sentence \( G \) is a \coloremph{semantic consequence}
	of a set of sentences
	\( \Gamma = \{ F_1,\ldots,F_n \} \) if \( G \) holds in all models for \( F_1,\ldots,F_n \).
	We write \( \Gamma\entails G \) and say that \( \Gamma \) entails \(G\).
	Two sentences are \coloremph{equivalent},
	denoted \( F \equival G \),
	if an only if the first sentence entails the second and vice versa.
	An \coloremph{equivalence transformation} morphs an arbitrary sentence \(F\)
	to another sentence \(F'\) such that \( F\equiv F'\).
	Equivalence transformations preserve
	validity \coloremph{and} satisfiability
	of sentences.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
	For an arbitrary first order sentence \( F \)
	we can easily see the composite sentence \( F\land\lnot F \)
	is unsatisfiable and entails every sentence,
	that the composite sentence \( F\lor\lnot F \) is valid and entailed by every sequence of sentences, and further that
	\begin{align*}
	\Delta, F&\entails G  &\text{if and only if} && \Delta &\entails \lnot F\lor G
	\\
	F_1,\ldots,F_n&\entails G  &\text{if and only if} && F_1\land\ldots\land F_n&\entails G
	\\
	F\land G&\equival G\land F &F\lor G\equival G\lor F && F\limp G &\equival \lnot F\lor G
	\\
	\quantify x (G) &\equiv \quantify x' (G \{x\mapsto x'\} )
	&\text{if } x' \not\in\fvar(G)
	&&\text{renaming of} &\text{ one bound variable}
	\end{align*}
	by the definitions for semantics, entailment, and equivalence.\hfill \( \qed \)
\end{example}

\begin{lemma}[Renaming of bound variables]\label{lem:quantified:variable:renaming}
	Let \( {F[G]}_p \)
	be a first order sentence with quantified subformula
	\( G = (\quantify x\,H) \) at position \( p \).
	We assume an injective position index function \( i(p) \),
	i.e.~\( \forall p \forall q (p \mEQ q \lor i(p) \mNE i(q)  ) \),
	from positions to natural numbers
	and \( x'_{i(p)} \not\in\var(F) \).
	Then \( G' = \quantify x'_{i(p)} (H\{x\mapsto x'_{i(p)}\}) \)
	is well-formed with
	\( G \equiv G' \) and
	\(
		{F[\,G\,]}_p
		\equiv
		{F[\,G'\,]}_p
	\).
\end{lemma}

\noindent We use Lemma~\ref{lem:quantified:variable:renaming}
to justify our assumption about first order sentences
in Definition~\ref{def:fof:closed} by renaming each
quantified variable by its position index.

\begin{definition}\label{def:equisatisfiable}
	Two sentences \( F \equisat G \) are \coloremph{equisatisfiable}
	if \( F \) is satisfiable whenever \( G \) is satisfiable
	and the other way round.
	A \coloremph{satisfiability transformation} morphs an arbitrary sentence
	\( F \) to a sentence \( F' \) such that \( F \equisat F' \).
	Satisfiability transformations respect the satisfiability of sentences,
	but the validity may differ between \( F \) and \( F' \).
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
	By itself equisatisfiability of arbitrary formulae
	usually gives no insights since
	any unsatisfiable formulae is equisatisfiable to \emph{any} unsatisfiable formula
	and any satisfiable formula is equisatisfiable to \emph{any} satisfiable formula by definition,
	e.g.\ \(\mP(\ma) \equisat \mb\mEQ\mc \). % chktex 21
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
	Let \( F \) be a sentence.
	Then \( F \equisat F \land \exists x \mP(x) \).
	But \( F \not\entails F \land \exists x \mP(x) \)
	as we can see for the tautology \( F = \mP(\ma)\lor\lnot\mP(\ma) \)
	and interpretation \( \mP_\mcI = \emptyset \).
\end{example}


% \begin{example}
% 	\begin{align*}
% 		\{ \mcC\lor p, \mcD\lor\lnot p \} &\entails \{ \mcC\lor p, \mcD\lor\lnot p, \mcC\lor\mcD \}
% 		\\
% 		\{ \mcC\lor p, \mcD\lor\lnot p \} &\equisat \{ \mcC\lor p, \mcD\lor\lnot p, \mcC\lor\mcD \}
% 		\\
% 		\{ \mcC\lor p, \mcD\lor\lnot p \} &\not\equiv \{ \mcC\lor p, \mcD\lor\lnot p, \mcC\lor\mcD \}
% 	\end{align*}
% \end{example}

\begin{example}
	Let \(F\) be an arbitrary formula with \( \fvar(F) = \{ x \} \).
	It is easy to see that in general
	\( F\{ x\mapsto\ma \} \not\equiv F\{ x\mapsto\mb \} \)
	but
	\( F\{ x\mapsto\ma \} \equisat F\{ x\mapsto\mb \} \),
	e.g.~we can construct a model such that
	\(\mP(\ma)\) holds but \(\mP(\mb)\) does not.
	But undoubtedly \(\mP(\ma)\) is as satisfiable as
	 \(\mP(\mb)\).
\end{example}

\begin{example}
	\( \exists x \, \mP(x) \equisat \mP(\ma) \), but only
	\( \mP(\ma) \entails \exists x \, \mP(x) \) holds.
\end{example}

% \begin{example}
% 	\[
% 	\{ \, \mP(x, \mf(x)), \, \mQ(y,\ma)\, \}
% 	\equisat \forall x\exists y(\mP(x,y)) \land \exists a\forall y(\mQ(y,a)) .
% 	\]
% \end{example}


\subsection{Equality}

\begin{example}\label{ex:a:neq:a}
	Any interpretation \( \mcI \)
	with \( {\mEQ_\mcI} = \emptyset \) satisfies \( \ma\mNE\ma \).
\end{example}

\noindent In Definition~\vref{def:semantics:atoms} we allowed
to interpret the equality symbol without restrictions.
This may yield unwelcome models as in Example~\vref{ex:a:neq:a}.
Hence we state useful definitions to deal with this situation
and demonstrate their usage in an example.


\begin{definition}\label{def:normal:interpreation}
	A \coloremph{normal} interpretation defines \( \mEQ_\mcI \) as identity on its domain,
	e.g.~the equation of terms \( s \mEQ_\mcI t \) holds if and only
	if any evaluation of its terms are equal \( \alpha_\mcI(s) = \alpha_\mcI(t) \)
	for all assignments \( \alpha \).
	In other words a normal interpretation yields different elements
	for ground terms \( s' \) and \( t' \) if and only if \( s'\mNE_\mcI t' \).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	A \coloremph{term interpretation}
	\( \mcI_t \)
	is an interpretation
	where the elements of its domain \( A = \mcTFf/_\sim \)
	are equivalence classes of ground terms
	and the interpretation of each ground term \( t^{\mcI_t} := {[t]}_\sim \) is its equivalence class.
	%		An equation \( s\mEQ t \) of ground terms holds in if \( [s]_\sim=[t]_\sim \).
	A ground predicate \( \mP(t_1,\ldots,t_n) \) holds if
	\( ({[t_1]}_\sim,\ldots,{[t_n]}_\sim) \in \mP^{\mcI_t} \subseteq A^n \).
	%	A ground literal does not hold if and only if its complementary literal holds.
	%	In an \coloremph{equational} term interpretation an equation \( s\mEQ t \) holds if an only if \( s\sim t \).
\end{definition}


\begin{example}
	Consider the satisfiable set of clauses \( S = \{ \mf(x) \mEQ x \} \).
	%
	We easily find a Herbrand model \( \mcH \) with
	predicate definition
	\( \mEQ_\mcH = \{ (\mf^{i+1}(\ma)), \mf^{i}(\ma) \mid i\geq 0  \}  \).
	However \( \mcH \) is not a normal model because obviously \( \mf(\ma)\neq\ma \) in its domain.
	%
	Further on we easily find a normal model \( \mcM \)
	with domain \( \{ \mc \} \), function definition \( \mf_\mcM(\mc) = \mc \),
	and the relation \( {\mEQ_\mcM} = \{ (\mc,\mc)\} \) coincides with identity in its domain.
	Certainly this model \( \mcM \) is not an Herbrand model
	because the interpretation of the ground term \( {\mf(\mc)}_\mcM = \mf_\mcM(\mc)=\mc \) is not the ground term \( \mf(\mc) \) itself.
	%
	On the other hand we easily construct a normal term model
	\( \mcM_t \) with domain \( \{ {[\ma]}_\sim \} \),
	a plain function definition
	\( \mf_{\mcM_t}({[\ma]}_\sim) \mapsto {[\ma]}_\sim \)
	with equivalence relation
	\( \ma \sim \mf(\ma) \).
	Hence \( \mEQ_{\mcM_t} \) agrees to equality in its domain of equivalence classes of ground terms.
\end{example}

%How we find a normal model or justify its existence we will discuss in Section \vref{sec:automation} about Automation.

\section{Term Rewriting and Term Orderings}\label{sec:termrewriting}

Term rewriting provides theoretical foundations for practical procedures
when dealing with equations of terms.
This section follows basic definitions and notions as in~\cite{AM2015L}.

\begin{definition}\label{def:rewrite:signature}
	A term rewrite signature \( \mcFf \) is a set of function symbols
	with associated arities
	as in Definition~\ref{def:signature}.
	Terms, term variables, ground terms and unary function symbol notations
	are defined as in Definitions~\ref{def:terms} to~\ref{def:unary:power}.
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}\label{def:rewriterule}
	A \coloremph{rewrite rule} \( \ell\rwStep r \) is an equation of terms where the left-hand side is not a variable
	and the variables occuring in the right-hand side occur also in the left-hand side.
	%	\[
	%		\ell\rwEQ r \text{ is rewrite rule }\quad :\Longleftrightarrow\quad\ell\not\in\mcV\text{ and }\var(r)\subseteq\var(l)
	%	\]
	A rewrite rule \( \ell'\rwStep r' \) is a \coloremph{variant} of \( \ell\rwStep r \) if there is a variable renaming \( \varrho \)
	such that
	\( (\ell\rightarrow r)\varrho := \ell\varrho\rightarrow r\varrho = l'\rightarrow r' \).
	A \coloremph{term rewrite system} (TRS) is a set of rewrite rules without variants.
	In a \coloremph{ground} term rewrite system every term on every side in every rule is a ground term.
\end{definition}

%
\begin{definition}
	We say \( s\rightarrow_\mcR t \) is a
	\coloremph{rewrite step}
	 with respect to TRS \( \mcR \)
	when there is a position \( p \in \pos(s) \),
	a rewrite rule \( \ell\rwStep r\in\mcR \),
	and a substitution \( \sigma \) such that
	\( s|_p=\ell\sigma \) and \( s{[r\sigma]}_p = t \).
		The subterm \( \ell\sigma \) is called \coloremph{redex} and
	\( s \) rewrites to \( t \) by \coloremph{contracting} \( \ell\sigma \) to \coloremph{contractum} \( r\sigma \).
	%
	We say a term \( s \) is \coloremph{irreducible} or in \coloremph{normal form} with respect to TRS \( \mcR \) if there is no rewrite step \( s\rightarrow_\mcR t \) for any term \( t \).
	The set of normal forms \( \mNFR \) contains all irreducible terms of the TRS \( \mcR \).

	\end{definition}

Although we use the the same symbol for implications \( F\limp G \) between first order formulae
and rewrite rules \( s\rwStep t \) or rewrite steps \( s'\rwStep_\mcR t \) between first order terms,
there will not arise any ambiguity for the reader about the role of the symbol,
because the implication is used between first order formulae
and the rewrite symbol is used between (function) terms.
%
%\begin{definition}
%	A \coloremph{rewrite relation} is a binary relation on terms that is closed under contexts and substitutions.
%	A \coloremph{rewrite order} is a proper order on terms
%	(i.e. an irreflexive and transitive relation on terms) and a rewrite relation.
%	A \coloremph{reduction order} is a well-founded rewrite order.
%\end{definition}
%
\begin{definition}
	A term \( s \) can be rewritten to term \( t \) with notion \( s\rightarrow^*_\mcR t \)
	if there exists at least one \coloremph{rewrite sequence} \( (a_1,\ldots ,a_n) \) such that
	\( s=a_1 \), \( a_n=t \), and \( a_i\rightarrow_\mcR a_{i+1} \) are rewrite steps for \( 1\leq i<n \).
	A TRS is \coloremph{terminating} if there is no infinite rewrite sequence of terms.
	%
% 	Two Terms \( s \) and \( t \) are \coloremph{joinable} with notion \( s\downarrow t \)
% 	if both can be rewritten to some term \( c \), i.e.~\( s \rightarrow^*c\ \, ^*\!\!\leftarrow t \).
% %
% 	Two Terms \( s \) and \( t \) are \coloremph{meetable} with notion \( s\uparrow t \)
% 	if both can be rewritten from some common ancestor term \( a \), i.e.~\( s \leftarrow^*a\ \, ^*\!\!\rightarrow t \).
% %
% 	A TRS is \coloremph{confluent } if \( s \) and \( t \) are joinable whenever \( s\ ^*\!\!\leftarrow a \rightarrow^* t \) holds for some term \( a \).
% 	%
% 	Terms \( s \) and \( t \) are \coloremph{convertible} with notion \( s\leftrightarrow^* t \)
% 	if there exists a sequence \( (a_1,\ldots ,a_n) \) such that
% 	\( s=a_1 \), \( a_n=t \), and \( a_i\leftrightarrow a_{i+1} \), i.e.~\( a_i\rightarrow a_{i+1} \) or \( a_i\leftarrow a_{i+1} \) are rewrite steps for \( 1\leq i<n \).
\end{definition}
%
\begin{definition}\label{def:closed-under}
	A \coloremph{rewrite relation} is a binary relation
	\( \relation \) on arbitrary terms \( s \) and \( t \),
	which additionally is \coloremph{closed under contexts}
	(whenever \( s\relation t \) then \( u{[s]}_p\relation u{[t]}_p \)
	for an arbitrary term \( u \) and any position \( p\in\pos(u) \))
	and \coloremph{closed under substitutions}
	(whenever \( s\relation t \) then \( s\sigma\relation t\sigma \)
	for an arbitrary substitution \( \sigma \)).
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
	Let \( \mcR \) be a TRS, \( s \) and \( t \) be terms.
	The relation \( s \rightarrow^*_\mcR t \) holds if \( s \) can be rewritten to \( t \).
	\( s \rightarrow^+_\mcR t \) holds \( s \) can be rewritten to \( t \)
	and the length of the rewrite sequence is at least one,
	relation \( s \downarrow_\mcR t \) holds if there is a term \( r \) such that
	\( r \rightarrow^*_\mcR s \) and \( r \rightarrow^*_\mcR t \), and
	relation \( \uparrow_\mcR \) holds if there is a term \( u \) such that
	\( s \rightarrow^*_\mcR u \) and \( t \rightarrow^*_\mcR u \).
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}
	The relations \( \rightarrow^*_\mcR \),
	\( \rightarrow^+_\mcR \),
	\( \downarrow_\mcR \), \( \uparrow_\mcR \) are rewrite relations on every TRS \( \mcR \).
\end{lemma}
%%
\begin{definition}\label{def:simplification:order}
	A proper (i.e.~irreflexive and transitive) order on terms is called \coloremph{rewrite order} if it is a rewrite relation.
	A \coloremph{reduction order} is a well-founded rewrite order,
	i.e.~there is no infinite sequence
	\( {(a_i)}_{i\in\mathbb{N}} \)
	where \( a_i\succ a_{i+1} \) for all \( i \).
	% with \( i\in\mathbb{N} \).
	A \coloremph{simplification order} is a rewrite order with the \coloremph{subterm property},
	i.e.~\( u{[t]}_p \succ t \) for all terms \( u \), \( t \) and positions \( p\neq\epsilon \).
\end{definition}

\begin{figure}[htb]\label{fig:simplification:order}
	\input{DRAWINGS/ProperOrder}
	\caption{Properties of relations on terms}
\end{figure}

Figure~\vref{fig:simplification:order} summarizes the properties of relations on terms.
The solid arrows mark definitions,
e.g.~a rewrite order is closed under contexts and substitutions (Definition~\ref{def:closed-under});
a simplification order is a rewrite order
that respects the subterm property
(Definition~\ref{def:simplification:order}).
The dotted arrows mark derived properties,
e.g.~every simplification order is a reduction order
(Lemma~\ref{lem:siplifiaction:order:well:founded});
transitive and irreflexive relations are always asymmetric,
etc.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:siplifiaction:order:well:founded}
	Every simplification order is well-founded, hence it is a reduction order.
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}
	A TRS \( \mcR \) is terminating if and only if there exists a reduction order \( \succ \)
	such that \( l\succ r \) for every rewrite rule \( l\rightarrow r\in\mcR \).
	We call \( \mcR \) simply terminating if \( \succ \) is a simplification order.
\end{theorem}


\begin{lemma}
% A well-founded and total order on general ground terms always exists.
% \end{lemma}
% \begin{lemma}
    A total simplification order
    over ground terms always exists~\cite{NR2001}.
\end{lemma}

% \subsection{Clause and literal orderings}\label{sec:clause:and:literal:orderings}

\begin{lemma}
	Any ordering \( \succ \) on a set \( C \) can be extended to an ordering on multisets over \( C \)
	as follows \( N \succ M \) if \( N \neq M \)
	and whenever there is \( x\in C \) with \( N(x) < M(x) \)
	then there is \( y \succ x \) with \( N(y) > M(y) \).

	An ordering \( \succ \) on terms can be extended to orderings on literals and clauses.
\end{lemma}




% % 2.4
% For the following definition we assume
% \( \succG \) as a a total, well-founded and monotone extension
% from a total simplification ordering on ground terms
% to ground clauses~\cite{NR2001}.

% \begin{lemma}A well-founded and total order on general ground terms always exists.\end{lemma}

	\begin{definition}[Order on literals]\label{def:orders-on-literals}
		We extend a well-founded and total order \( \succ \) on general ground terms,
		i.e~general atoms to a well-founded proper order \( \succ_\mL \)
		on literals such that for all atoms \( A \) and \( B \) with \( A\succ B \)
		the relations \( A\succ_\mL B \),
		\( \lnot A\succ_\mL\lnot B \) and
		\( \lnot A\succ_\mL A \) hold.
		%
		A (non-ground) literal \( L \) is \coloremph{(strictly) maximal} if there exists a ground substitution \( \tau \)
		such for no other literal \( L' \) the relation \( L'\tau\succ L\tau \) (strictly: \( \succcurlyeq \)) holds.
		We write \( \succ_{gr} \) to suggest the existence of such a ground substitution \( \tau \).
